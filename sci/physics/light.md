# Light - a wave/particle duality

Most textbooks say that you can model light as an electromagnetic wave xor as a stream of photons ("xor" prevents using both models at the same time).

*Light as a wave*: in this model, a changing electric field creates a changing magnetic field. This changing magnetic field then creates a changing electric field, so fiat lux. Unlike the sound waves, light doesn't need a medium to propagate - in fact, it develops its top speed in the vacuum of space.

*Light as a particle*: Some textbooks might start off with an experimental evidence from the historic photoelectric effect to show that the wave model of light doesn't always describe what happens, suggesting that we can model light as individual particles (some books actually say "particles", while others just say "photons"). These paticles of light then have the energy that depends on the wavelength. (With the photon model, a brighter light just produces more photons per second).

Whether light is a particle or a wave is a difficult question, the answer to which depends on a particular situation: sometimes light behaves as a particle and sometimes as a wave.
