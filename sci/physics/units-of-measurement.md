## Myr
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myr

The abbreviation `myr`, million years, is a unit of a quantity of 1,000,000 (that is 1e6 or 1×10⁶) years, or 31.556926 teraseconds.


Myr (million years) is in common use in fields like *Earth science* and *cosmology*. `myr` is also used with `mya` (million years ago) - together they make a reference system, one to a quantity, the other to a particular place in a year numbering system that is time before the present (i.e. at the epoch, which is set to some date around 1950's, as that was the time the carbon dating was disovered).

Myr is deprecated in geology, but in astronomy it is standard. Where *myr* is seen in geology it is usually *Myr*, as a unit of mega-years. In astronomy, it is usually *Myr*, as "Million years".

- `bya` billion 10⁹ (of) years ago
- `mya` million 10⁶ years ago
- `kya` thousand 10³ years ago
- `kyr` thousand years
- `myr` million years, unit of a quantity of 1 million (10⁶) years
- `Myr` million (of) years (in geology, as duration)
- `Ma`  million (of) years ago (in geology, as a historic period)

In the traditional style, geology literature may say, e.g. "The Cretaceous started 145 Ma and ended 66 Ma, lasting for 79 Myr".
