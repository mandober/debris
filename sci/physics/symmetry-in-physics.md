# Symmetry in physics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(physics)

Symmetry in physics has been generalized to mean invariance (the lack of change) under any kind of transformation (e.g. arbitrary coordinate transformations - i.e. parity transformations).

>In physics, a symmetry of a physical system is a physical or mathematical feature of the system (observed or intrinsic) that is preserved or remains unchanged under some transformation.

Arguably the most important example of a symmetry in physics is that **the speed of light has the same value in all frames of reference**, which is described in special relativity by a group of transformations of the spacetime known as the *Poincar√© group*.

Another important example is **the invariance of the form of physical laws under arbitrary differentiable coordinate transformations**, which is an important idea in *general relativity*.

The concept of symmetry has become one of the most powerful tools of theoretical physics, as it has become evident that practically all laws of nature originate in symmetries. In fact, this has inspired the Nobel laureate P. W. Anderson to write, in his 1972's article "More is Different", that *"it is only slightly overstating the case to say that physics is the study of symmetry"*.


Noether's theorem and Wigner's classification are important results related to symmetry. *Noether's theorem*, roughly, says that for every continuous mathematical symmetry, there is a corresponding conserved quantity such as energy or momentum. *Wigner's classification* says that the symmetries of the laws of physics determine the properties of the particles found in nature.

Important symmetries in physics include
- continuous symmetries and discrete symmetries of spacetime
- internal symmetries of particles
- supersymmetry of physical theories (of forms of physical theories)

**Rotational symmetry** (aka radial symmetry in geometry) is the property a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn. An object's *degree of rotational symmetry* is the number of distinct orientations in which it looks exactly the same for each rotation.

**Discrete symmetry** is a symmetry that describes non-continuous changes in a system. For example, a square possesses discrete rotational symmetry, as only rotations by multiples of 90 degree angles will preserve the square's original appearance. Discrete symmetries sometimes involve some type of "swapping", where the swaps are usually called reflections (or interchanges). In mathematics and theoretical physics, *a discrete symmetry is a symmetry under the transformations of a discrete group*, e.g. a topological group with a discrete topology whose elements form a finite or a countable set. One of the most prominent discrete symmetries in physics is **parity symmetry**, which is manifested in various elementary physical quantum systems, such as quantum harmonic oscillator, electron orbitals of Hydrogen-like atoms by forcing wavefunctions to be even or odd. This in turn gives rise to selection rules that determine which transition lines are visible in atomic absorption spectra.

**Continuous symmetry** is an intuitive idea corresponding to the concept of viewing some symmetries as motions, as opposed to discrete symmetry (e.g. reflection symmetry) that is invariant under a kind of flip from one state to another. However, a discrete symmetry can always be reinterpreted as a subset of some higher-dimensional continuous symmetry. For example, reflection of a 2D object in 3D space can be achieved by continuously rotating that object 180 degrees across a non-parallel plane.
