## Laws of thermodynamics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics

The 4 fundamental laws of thermodynamics express empirical facts and define physical quantities, such as temperature, heat, thermodynamic work, and entropy, that characterize thermodynamic processes and thermodynamic systems in *thermodynamic equilibrium*. They describe the relationships between these quantities, and form a basis for precluding the possibility of certain phenomena, such as perpetual motion.

Traditionally, thermodynamics has stated 3 fundamental laws: the first law, the second law, and the third law.

A more fundamental statement was later labelled the 'zeroth law'. The law of conservation of mass is also an equally fundamental concept in the theory of thermodynamics, but it is not generally included as a law of thermodynamics.

**The zeroth law of thermodynamics** defines *thermal equilibrium* and forms a basis for the definition of temperature. It says that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

**The first law of thermodynamics** says that when energy passes into or out of a system (as work, heat, or matter), the system's internal energy changes in accord with *the law of conservation of energy*. Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the first kind (machines that produce work with no energy input) are impossible.

In general, **the law of conservation of energy** states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed, it can only change form.

**The second law of thermodynamics** states that the entropy always increases. It may decrease within an isolated system (like a refrigirator) but that requires work (electric energy) and the entropy of the encompasing system (up to the universe) increases.

The second law can be expressed in two main ways. In terms of possible processes, Rudolf Clausius stated that heat does not spontaneously pass from a colder body to a warmer body. Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the second kind (machines that spontaneously convert thermal energy into mechanical work) are impossible. In terms of entropy, in a natural thermodynamic process, the sum of the entropies of interacting thermodynamic systems increases.

The second law indicates the irreversibility of natural processes, and, in many cases, the tendency of natural processes to lead towards spatial homogeneity of matter and energy, and especially of temperature.

When two initially isolated systems in separate but nearby regions of space, each in thermodynamic equilibrium with itself but not necessarily with each other, are then allowed to interact, they will eventually reach a mutual thermodynamic equilibrium. The sum of the entropies of the initially isolated systems is less than or equal to the total entropy of the final combination. Equality occurs just when the two original systems have all their respective intensive variables (temperature, pressure) equal; then the final system also has the same values.

The second law seems to be the only law of physics that cares about the direction of the flow of time. While other laws are time-reversable, only the second law of thermodynamics seems time-irresversable.


**The third law of thermodynamics** states that a system's entropy approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.

With the exception of non-crystalline solids (glasses) the entropy of a system at absolute zero is typically close to zero.

Time and the flow of time is separate from entropy - if entropy of an isolated system decreases, time surely does not reverse within it, although it may appear so.
