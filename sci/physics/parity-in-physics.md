# Parity in physics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics)

In quantum mechanics, a **parity transformation** (also called *parity inversion*) is the flip in the sign of one spatial coordinate.

In 3D, it can also refer to the simultaneous flip in the sign of all 3 spatial coordinates, i.e. a *point reflection*.

>Parity inversion transforms a physical phenomenon into its mirror image, which can be used to test its chirality.

All fundamental interactions of elementary particles, with the exception of the *weak force*, are symmetric under parity.

**The weak interaction is chiral** and thus provides a means for probing chirality in physics. That is, physics can, after all, tell left from right thanks to the weak force.

In interactions that are symmetric under parity (i.e. with electromagnetism, gravity and strong force; that is, all 4 forces except the weak force) parity serves as a powerful controlling principle underlying quantum transitions.
