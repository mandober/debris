# Chirality

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality

**Chirality** is a property of asymmetry important in several branches of science, especially physics. The word chirality is derived from the Greek χειρ (kheir), "hand", the most familiar *chiral* object.

An object or a system is **chiral** if it is *distinguishable from its mirror image*. Such an object has the property of **chirality**. A chiral object cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image.

Conversely, a mirror image of an **achiral** object, such as a sphere, is indistinguishable from the original, non-mirrored, image. An achiral object can be superposed onto its mirror image.

A chiral object and its mirror image are called **enantiomorphs** (Greek, "opposite forms") or, when referring to molecules, **enantiomers**.

The term "chirality" was first used by Lord Kelvin in 1893: "I call any geometrical figure, or group of points, 'chiral', and say that it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror, ideally realized, cannot be brought to coincide with itself". (i.e. cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image).

Hands (of humans) are perhaps the most recognized example of chirality. The left hand is a non-superimposable mirror image of the right hand: no matter how the two hands are oriented, it is impossible for all the major features of both hands to coincide across all axes. This difference in symmetry becomes obvious if someone attempts to shake the right hand of a person using their left hand, or if a left-handed glove is placed on a right hand.

>In mathematics, chirality is the property of a figure that is not identical to its mirror image.

In mathematics, a figure is chiral (and said to have chirality) if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by rotations and translations alone. For example, a right shoe is different from a left shoe, and clockwise is different from anticlockwise.

## Chirality in physics

In physics, chirality may be found in the spin of a particle, where the handedness of the object is determined by the direction in which the particle spins.

Not to be confused with *helicity*, which is the projection of the spin along the linear momentum of a subatomic particle, chirality is an intrinsic quantum mechanical property, like spin.

Although both chirality and helicity can have left-handed or right-handed properties, only in the massless case are they identical. In particular for a massless particle the helicity is the same as the chirality, while for an antiparticle they have opposite sign.

The handedness in both chirality and helicity relate to the rotation of a particle while it proceeds in linear motion with reference to the human hands. The thumb of the hand points towards the direction of linear motion, whilst the fingers curl into the palm, representing the direction of rotation of the particle (i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise). Depending on the linear and rotational motion, the particle can either be defined by left-handedness or right-handedness. A symmetry transformation between the two is called *parity*. Invariance under parity by a Dirac fermion is called *chiral symmetry*.
