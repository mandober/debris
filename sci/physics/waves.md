# Light as a wave

The wave nature of light is quite different from that of sound. In its simplest form, an *electromagnetic wave* (such as light, radio, or microwave) is transverse, consisting of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that are perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

Moreover, although the medium through which light travels does affect its speed (reducing it by the index of refraction of the material), light can also travel through a vacuum, thus providing a unique context for defining its speed.

In fact, *the speed of light in a vacuum*, denoted by the constant `c` (one of a number of fundamental physical constants), is a fundamental building block of Einstein's theory of relativity because it sets the upper limit for top speed in the universe.
