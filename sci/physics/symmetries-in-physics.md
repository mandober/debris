# Symmetries in physics

3 symmetries
- `C` charge symmetry (+ / -)
- `P` parity symmetry (left / right; chirality)
- `T` time symmetry (backwards / forwards flow of time)

4 fundamental forces
- gravity
- electromagnetism
- weak nuclear force
- string nuclear force


In physics, there are 3 symmetries expected to always hold: charge (C), parity (P) and time (T).

**Time symmetry** means that physical processes work the same way forwards or backwards in time.

**Charge symmetry** means physical processes are unaffected if all the charges are swapped - in other words, there is nothing special about what we call positive charge - nature treats it exactly the same but opposite to negative charge.

**Parity symmetry** means the laws of physics are indifferent to left or right-handedness (*chirality*), i.e. the laws of physics can't tell left from right.


## Time Symmetry

Most processes in our universe are time-reversible - the physics works the same way forwards or backwards. Entropy is often cited as the only exception to this rule. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system (the amount of disorder) always increases with time. However, the entropy is an emergent property, the result of motions of many particles - which raises the question - can fundamental particles themselves tell the direction of time? In other words, is there a physical process, at the scale of individual particles, that looks different wrt forwards and backwards flow of time? Surprisingly, the answer is affirmative.
