We shared the Last Common Ancestor (LCA) with apes some 250,000 generations ago.

>There are estimated 250,000 generations between `Pan Troglodytes` (ape) and `Homo Sapiens`.

That is, from today's perspective of the modern man, many of us can trace their lineage to at least a few previous generations. If we label you as gen 0 (2⁰ people), your parents are then gen 1 (or gen -1 to denote the previous and not the future genrations), and the pair of your grandparents are gen 2 (2² people), your grand-grandparents are gen 3 (2³ people), then come the 16 people (2⁴) comprising the gen -4 relative to you, and so on. The gen 250000 are your ancestors, monekeys as well.
