# GLOSSARY

**Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** is a molecule composed of two *polynucleotide* chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids.

Four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life: proteins, lipids, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), polysaccharides (complex carbohydrates).

Generic code is highly similar among all organisms. Generic code can be expressed in a table with 64 entries. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) and gene-environment interactions.

**Gene prediction** or gene finding refers to the process of identifying the regions of genomic DNA that encode genes. This includes protein-coding genes as well as RNA genes, but may also include prediction of other functional elements such as regulatory regions.

**Gene expression** is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product that enables it to produce end products (protein or non-coding RNA), and ultimately affect a phenotype, as the final effect.

**Interphase** is the period of the cell cycle where the cell is not dividing.

**Mitosis** is a part of the cell cycle in which replicated chromosomes are separated into two new nuclei. Cell division gives rise to genetically identical cells in which the total number of chromosomes is maintained. Therefore, mitosis is also known as *equational division*.

**Meiosis** is a special type of cell division of germ cells in sexually reproducing organisms used to produce the *gametes*, such as sperm or egg cells. It involves two rounds of division that ultimately result in four cells with only one copy of each chromosome (haploid). Additionally, prior to the division, genetic material from the paternal and maternal copies of each chromosome is *crossed over*, creating new combinations of code on each chromosome.

The **genetic code** is the set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences of nucleotide triplets, or *codons*) into proteins.

**Translation of genetic code** is accomplished by the ribosome, which links proteinogenic amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using tRNA molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA 3 nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.

**Codon** is DNA or mRNA sequences of nucleotide triplets. The codons specify which amino acid will be added next during protein synthesis. With some exceptions, a 3-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme is often referred to as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply the genetic code, though variant codes (such as in mitochondria) exist.

A **codon table** can be used to translate a genetic code into a sequence of amino acids.

The 3 consecutive DNA bases, called *nucleotide triplets* or *codons*, are translated into amino acids, e.g. `GCA` to alanine, `AGA` to arginine, `GAT` to aspartic acid, `AAT` to asparagine, `TGT` to cysteine.

The standard RNA codon table organized in a wheel. The standard genetic code is traditionally represented as an RNA codon table, because when proteins are made in a cell by ribosomes, it is mRNA that directs protein synthesis.

A circular diagram is separated into 3 rings, broken down into sections labeled with the 4 letters: `G`, `U`, `A`, `C`. Each represents a nucleotide found in RNA. The center ring is divided into 4 areas marked with a unique letter. The second ring is divided into 16 sections also labeled with a nucleotide. They are organized so that the outer edge of the central letters touches 4 unique nucleotides. The third outer ring, divided into 64 sections labeled with a nucleotide, repeats this.

Amino acids are placed outside of the circular diagram and are in contact with specific nucleotides. Using this diagram, one can connect a sequence of 3 nucleotides with a specific amino acid. For example, given `GUC`, you locate `G` in the central ring, `U` in the middle one, and `C` in the outer ring, discovering that G -> U -> C gives the amino acid `Alanine`.

* Mutations: point mutations (single nucleotid, i.e. one base pair), duplication events, insetions, deletions, lateral gene tranfers, gene fission, gene fusion, de novo originations, TE protein domestication

Gene duplication: duplication of a gene responsible for coding a certain protein (like Factor X, which is blood coagulant that "corks" a cut vessel) makes both gene code for the same protein initially. However, one may drift apart by accumulating mutations so that the protein it codes for is changed to some degree. For example, venomous snakes had a copy of Factor X coding gene, and while the "original" gene kept coding snake's own Factor X, the copy went through so many mutations it became a very effective venom (still based on Factor X proteins - snake bite actually injects fast-acting Factor X into a victim's bloodstream causing trombosis, and death).
