# Chromosome

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome

A **chromosome** is a long DNA molecule with (part or all of) the genetic material of an organism.

Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins called *histones* which, aided by chaperone proteins, bind to and condense the DNA molecule to maintain its integrity. These chromosomes display a complex 3D structure, which plays a significant role in *transcriptional regulation*.

Chromosomes are normally visible under a microscope only during the *metaphase* of *cell division*.

Chromosomal recombination during meiosis and subsequent sexual reproduction play a significant role in genetic diversity.


Two types of chromatin can be distinguished during interphase:
1. *Euchromatin* consists of active DNA, e.g. being expressed as protein
2. *Heterochromatin* consists of mostly inactive DNA (seems to serve structural purposes during the chromosomal stages), and has two types:
  * *Constitutive heterochromatin* is never expressed
  (located around the centromere, usually contains repetitive sequences)
  * *Facultative heterochromatin* is sometimes expressed


* Although each individual nucleotide is very small, a DNA polymer can be very large and may contain hundreds of millions of nucleotides, such as in chromosome 1. *Chromosome 1* is the largest human chromosome with approximately 220 million base pairs, and would be 85 mm long if straightened.

* Each eukaryotic chromosome consists of a long linear DNA molecule associated with proteins, forming a compact complex of proteins and DNA called *chromatin*.

* Chromatin contains the vast majority of the DNA of an organism; a small amount of maternally inherited DNA can be found in the mitochondria.

* Chromatin is present in most cells, except e.g. in *red blood cells*. (in humans and other animals, RBC have no nucleus. RBC take up oxygen in the lungs, or in fish the gills, and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body's capillaries).
