# Speed of light

- C = 299,792,448 m/s
- C = 299,792 m/ms
- C = 299 m/Î¼s
- C = 0.299 m/ns
- A beam of light traverses 22 cm in 0.3 ns
- A beam of light traverses 222 mm in 0.3 ns
- A beam of light traverses 666 mm in 1 ns
- A beam of light traverses 666x16,666,666 mm in 16.6 ms = 16,666,666 ns
                            11,100,000,000 mm =

                            11,100 km
- >One cycle of a CPU at 1 GHz lasts 1 ns
- >One cycle of a CPU at 3.3 GHz lasts 0.33 ns




- Speed of electrons in a circuitry: 50-90% of `c` (90% for gold conductors)
- It takes light 1.26s to travel from the Earth to the Moon

* It takes about 12 minutes for a beam of light emitted from the Sun to reach Earth. If the Sun were to instantly dissappear, we wouldn't know anything about it for at least 12 minutes (ignorance is bliss). Eventually, when the sun does get extinguished, we'd still be good to savor that last drink.
