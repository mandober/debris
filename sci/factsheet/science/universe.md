The earliest stages of the universe's existence are estimated as taking place *13.8 billion years ago*.

The Planck Collaboration published in 2015, puts the age of the universe at 
`13.799 Ā± 0.021` Gyr (with an uncertainty of +/- 21 million years and the 68% confidence level).


In the Milky Way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center. The Sun is pretty consistent, keeping the distance of around *30,000 LY* and completing an orbit every *230 million years*.

Although the light year is a commonly used unit, astronomers prefer a different unit called the parsec (pc). A *parsec, equal to 3.26 ly*, is defined as the distance at which 1 Astronomical Unit subtends an angle of 1 second of arc (1/3600 of a degree). When we use the parsec for really large distances, we often put a prefix in front of it - like kiloparsecs (kpc), which are equal to 1000 parsecs - or Megaparsecs (Mpc), equal to a million parsecs.

The Milky Way is about **1,000,000,000,000,000,000 km** (about *100,000 ly* or about *30 kpc*) across.

The Sun does not lie near the center of our Galaxy. It lies about *8 kpc* from the center on what is known as the `Orion Arm` of the Milky Way.

- Jupiter is 1/10 of the diameter of the Sun.
- Earth is 1/11 of the diameter of the Jupiter.
- 1 AU = 107.4 diameters of the Sun
- Earth is ~ 107.4 Sun's diameters (= 1 AU) from the Sun

sun to earth scale:
- diameter: `24 cm` (sun the basketball) : `2.2 mm` (earth the speck)
- earth would be 26 m (basketball court) away from the sun in this scale

- sun contributes 99.8 % of mass of the entire solar system
