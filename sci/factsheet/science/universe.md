# Unverse

* The earliest stages of the universe's existence are estimated as taking place *13.8 billion years ago*. The Planck Collaboration published in 2015, puts the age of the universe at `13.799 Ā± 0.021` Gyr (with an uncertainty of ± 21 million years and the 68% confidence level).

* In the Milky Way, billions of stars orbit the black hole at the galactic center (`galactic` means `milky`). The Sun is pretty consistent, keeping the distance of around 30,000 ly from the galactic center, and completing an orbit around it every 230 million years.

Although the light year is a commonly used unit, astronomers prefer a different unit called **parsec** (pc).

>1 parsec = 3.26 ly

Parsec is defined as the distance at which 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) subtends an angle of 1 second of arc (1/3600 of a degree).

1 AU = 107.4 Sun's diameters

When we use parsec for really large distances, we often put a prefix in front of it - like kiloparsecs (kpc) or Megaparsecs (Mpc).

The length of the Milky Way is

~1,000,000,000,000,000,000 km = ~100,000 ly = ~30 kpc

The Sun does not lie at or even near the center of our Galaxy - it lies about 8 kpc from the center of what is known as the *Orion Arm* of the Milky Way.

- 1 AU = 107.4 diameters (2r) of the Sun
- Earth is 1 AU (107.4 Sun's diameters) distant from the Sun
- Jupiter is 1/10 of the diameter of the Sun
- Earth is 1/11 of the diameter of the Jupiter.

Sun to earth scale
- diameter `24 cm` (sun-the-basketball) : `2.2 mm` (earth-the-speck)
- earth would be 26 m (basketball court) away from the sun in this scale
- Sun contributes 99.8% of mass of the entire solar system
