# population

- Total European population as of 2018: *751 million*
  - the most populous country in Europe: Russia, 146 million


- Europe's population growth is low, and its median age high. Most of Europe is in a mode of *sub-replacement fertility*, which means that each new(-born) generation is less populous than the older.

According to Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Helsinki, up to 7 million people lived in Europe in 3000 BCE.

Estimates for historical population sizes of Europe (including Central Asia, listed under "former USSR") in millions, with estimated percentage of world population:

- all numbers are in millions
- Pop - Europe population
- WT  - world total

- Europe in 1916: 330,000,000
- Europe in 1950: 549,000,000
- The population of Europe in 2015 was estimated to be 741 million, slightly less than 11% of the world population. The precise figure depends on the exact definition of the geographic extent of Europe.
- The population of the European Union (EU) was 509 million as of 2015.
- Non-EU countries situated in Europe in their entirety account for another 94 million.
- 5 transcontinental countries have a total of 247 million people, of which about half reside in Europe proper. Population in million: Armenia 2.9, Georgia 4.0, Kazakhstan 17.8, Russia 144, Turkey 78.3.
- As it stands now (2023), around 10% of the world's people live in Europe. If demographic trends keep their pace, its share may fall to around 7% in 2050, but still amounting to 716 million people in absolute numbers, according to the United Nations estimate. (The decline in the percentage is partly due to high fertility rates in Africa and South America). The sub-replacement fertility and high life expectancy in most European states mean a declining and aging population. High immigration and emigration levels within and from outside the continent are taking place and quickly changing countries, specifically in Western Europe, from a single ethnic group to a multicultural society.
