The root `alk-` is used in organic chemistry to form classification names for classes of organic compounds which contain a carbon skeleton but no aromatic rings. It was extracted from the word alcohol by removing the -ol suffix. See e.g. alkyl, alkane.

The prefix `aza-` is used in organic chemistry to form names of organic compounds where a carbon atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom. The related term "deaza-" refers to when a nitrogen is removed and, usually, a carbon atom is put in its place. Sometimes a number between hyphens is inserted before it to state which atom the nitrogen atom replaces. It arose by shortening the word azote, which is an obsolete name for nitrogen in the English language and occurs in current French usage (azote), meaning "nitrogen".

Deca- (and dec-) sometimes deka- is a common English-language numeral prefix derived from the Late Latin ("(set of) ten"), from Ancient Greek , from (d√©ka, "ten"). It is used in many words.

Dmitri Mendeleev published a periodic table of the chemical elements in 1869 based on properties that appeared with some regularity as he laid out the elements from lightest to heaviest. When Mendeleev proposed his periodic table, he noted gaps in the table and predicted that then-unknown elements existed with properties appropriate to fill those gaps. He named them `eka`-boron, eka-aluminium, eka-silicon, and eka-manganese, with respective atomic masses of 44, 68, 72, and 100.

In chemical nomenclature, `nor-` is a prefix to name a structural analog that can be derived from a parent compound by the removal of one carbon atom along with the accompanying hydrogen atoms. The `nor-` prefix also includes the elimination of a methylene bridge in a cyclic parent compound, followed by ring contraction.

`Lyso-` is a prefix applied to the various phospholipids to indicate the removal of one of the two fatty acids. For example, lysophosphatidylcholines are phosphatidylcholines with a single acyl group in either the 1- or 2-position.

In chemistry, `meta` is a prefix, used for systematic names in IUPAC nomenclature. It has several meanings.

The prefix `thio-`, when applied to a chemical, such as an ion, means that an oxygen atom in the compound has been replaced by a sulfur atom. This term is often used in organic chemistry.
