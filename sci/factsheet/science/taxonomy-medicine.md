## Branches of medicine

The main branches of medicine are:
- Basic sciences of medicine: what every physician is educated in
- Medical specialties
- Interdisciplinary fields: mix of medical specialties

## Basic sciences of medicine

- *Anatomy* is the study of the physical structure of organisms. In contrast to macroscopic or gross anatomy, cytology and histology are concerned with microscopic structures.

- *Biochemistry* is the study of the chemistry taking place in living organisms, especially the structure and function of their chemical components.

- *Biomechanics* is the study of the structure and function of biological systems by means of the methods of Mechanics.

- *Biostatistics* is the application of statistics to biological fields in the broadest sense. A knowledge of biostatistics is essential in the planning, evaluation, and interpretation of medical research. It is also fundamental to epidemiology and evidence-based medicine.

- *Biophysics* is an interdisciplinary science that uses the methods of physics and physical chemistry to study biological systems.

- *Cytology* is the microscopic study of individual cells.

- *Embryology* is the study of the early development of organisms.

- *Endocrinology* is the study of hormones and their effect throughout the body of animals.

- *Epidemiology* is the study of the demographics of disease processes, and includes, but is not limited to, the study of epidemics.

- *Genetics* is the study of genes, and their role in biological inheritance.

- *Histology* is the study of the structures of biological tissues by light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.

- *Immunology* is the study of the immune system, which includes the innate and adaptive immune system in humans, for example.

- *Lifestyle* medicine is the study of the chronic conditions, and how to prevent, treat and reverse them.

- *Medical* physics is the study of the applications of physics principles in medicine.

- *Microbiology* is the study of microorganisms, including protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

- *Molecular* biology is the study of molecular underpinnings of the process of replication, transcription and translation of the genetic material.

- *Neuroscience* includes those disciplines of science that are related to the study of the nervous system. A main focus of neuroscience is the biology and physiology of the human brain and spinal cord. Some related clinical specialties include neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry.

- *Nutrition* science (theoretical focus) and dietetics (practical focus) is the study of the relationship of food and drink to health and disease, especially in determining an optimal diet. Medical nutrition therapy is done by dietitians and is prescribed for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, weight and eating disorders, allergies, malnutrition, and neoplastic diseases.

- *Pathology* as a science is the study of disease-the causes, course, progression and resolution thereof.

- *Pharmacology* is the study of drugs and their actions.

- *Gynecology* is the study of female reproductive system.

- *Photobiology* is the study of the interactions between non-ionizing radiation and living organisms.

- *Physiology* is the study of the normal functioning of the body and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.

- *Radiobiology* is the study of the interactions between ionizing radiation and living organisms.

- *Toxicology* is the study of hazardous effects of drugs and poisons.


## Other major specialties

The following are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above-mentioned groups.

- *Anesthesiology* (also known as anaesthetics): concerned with the perioperative management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist's role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also serves the same function in the labor and delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.

- *Dermatology* is concerned with the skin and its diseases. In the UK, dermatology is a subspecialty of general medicine.

- *Emergency* medicine is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of acute or life-threatening conditions, including trauma, surgical, medical, pediatric, and psychiatric emergencies.

- *Family* medicine, family practice, general practice or primary care is, in many countries, the first port-of-call for patients with non-emergency medical problems. Family physicians often provide services across a broad range of settings including office based practices, emergency department coverage, inpatient care, and nursing home care.

- *Obstetrics* and gynecology (often abbreviated as OB/GYN (American English) or Obs & Gynae (British English)) are concerned respectively with childbirth and the female reproductive and associated organs. Reproductive medicine and fertility medicine are generally practiced by gynecological specialists.

- *Medical* genetics is concerned with the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.

- *Neurology* is concerned with diseases of the nervous system. In the UK, neurology is a subspecialty of general medicine.

- *Ophthalmology* is exclusively concerned with the eye and ocular adnexa, combining conservative and surgical therapy.

- *Pediatrics* (AE) or paediatrics (BE) is devoted to the care of infants, children, and adolescents. Like internal medicine, there are many pediatric subspecialties for specific age ranges, organ systems, disease classes, and sites of care delivery.

- *Pharmaceutical* medicine is the medical scientific discipline concerned with the discovery, development, evaluation, registration, monitoring and medical aspects of marketing of medicines for the benefit of patients and public health.

- *Physical* medicine and rehabilitation (or physiatry) is concerned with functional improvement after injury, illness, or congenital disorders.

- *Podiatric* medicine is the study of, diagnosis, and medical & surgical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle, lower limb, hip and lower back.

- *Psychiatry* is the branch of medicine concerned with the bio-psycho-social study of the etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cognitive, perceptual, emotional and behavioral disorders. Related fields include psychotherapy and clinical psychology.

- *Preventive* medicine is the branch of medicine concerned with preventing disease.

- *Public health* is an aspect of health services concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis.
