Lepenski Vir ("Lepena Whirlpool"), located in Serbia, is an archaeological site of the Mesolithic Iron Gates culture of the Balkans. The latest radiocarbon and AMS data suggests that the chronology of Lepenski Vir spans between 9500/7200-6000 BCE.

There is some disagreement about when the settlement and culture of Lepenski Vir began, but the latest data indicates that it was between 9500-7200 BCE.

The late Lepenski Vir (6300-6000 BCE) architectural phase saw the development of unique trapezoidal buildings and monumental sculpture. The Lepenski Vir site consists of one large settlement with around ten satellite villages. Numerous piscine sculptures and peculiar architectural remains have been found at the site.
