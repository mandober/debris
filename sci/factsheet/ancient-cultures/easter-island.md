# Easter Island

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island

In 1722, explorers happened upon the Easter island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. When they arrived, they discovered over 800 giant statues and almost no people. This was strange, since the small number of people on the island couldn't possibly have built these statues - it would have taken a much larger civilization.

Easter Island, a Chilean territory, is a remote volcanic island in Polynesia. Its native name is *Rapa Nui*. It's famed for archaeological sites, including nearly 900 monumental statues called *moai*, created by inhabitants during the 13th-16th centuries. The moai are carved human figures with oversize heads, often resting on massive stone pedestals called *ahus*. Ahu Tongariki has the largest group of upright moai.
