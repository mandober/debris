## HDD
- ~2018, the average HDD data density is ~ 15 GB/cm²
- ~2018, HDD write head flies about 5nm above the disk's surface

HDD performance characteristics can be grouped into two categories: access time and data transfer time (or rate).

- As of 2010, a typical 7,200 RPM desktop HDD has a "disk-to-buffer" data transfer rate up to `1.03 Gbit/s` = `1030 Mbit/s` = `128 MB/s` ⋘ SATA 3

- The sustained "disk-to-buffer" data transfer rates varies among optical disk drives with the slowest 1x CDs at 1.23 Mbit/s floppy-like, while a high performance *12x Blu-ray drive* at `432 Mbit/s` approaches the performance of HDDs.

- The current standard for the "buffer-to-computer" interface is `3.0 Gbit/s` (= `375 MB/s`) SATA 3, which can send about `300 MB/s` (10-bit encoding) from the buffer to the computer, and thus is still well ahead of today's disk-to-buffer transfer rates.



### First HDD

- HDD was invented in 1954 at IBM by the team led by Rey Johnson
  - First HDD model was IBM 350 Disk Storage Unit
  - The first HDD
    - invented: Dec 1954
    - inventor: IBM team led by Rey Johnson
    - prototype: June 1956
    - announced: Sep 1956 by IBM
    - retail: Nov 1957
    - first HDD model: IBM 350 Disk Storage Unit (DSU)


* The first disk drive ever
IBM 350 disk storage unit; succesfully prototyped in 1956, announced by IBM in 1956, begun shipping in 1957.
- capacity: 3.75 MB (5e+6 6-bit characters)
- disk diameter: 610 mm
- platters/disks number: 50
- recording surface: 100 (both sides of a platter)
- tracks per surface: 100
- rotation speed: 1200 rpm
- data transfer rate: 8,800 char/s
- price: leased for $3,200 per month (IBM RAMAC 305 system + IBM 350 DSU)
- withdrawn: 1969 (IBM 350 officially withdrawn)

IBM 350 DSU stored 5,000,000 chars, with each char being 6-bit, 
takes 3.6 MiB = ~3.75MB    
6 bits_per_char * 5e6 chars = 30,000,000 bits    
30,000,000 bits = 3,750,000 Bytes = 3,662 KiB = 3.6 MiB

An access mechanism moved a pair of heads up and down to select a disk pair (one down surface and one up surface) and in and out to select a recording track of a surface pair.
