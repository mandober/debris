# History : GLOSSARY

## Early Earth
The early Earth is loosely defined as Earth in its first one billion years (1 billion years = 1 gigayear (Ga) = 10⁹ years). The "early Earth" encompasses approx. the first gigayear in the evolution of Earth, from its initial formation, in the young Solar System at about 4.55 Ga, to sometime in the *Archean eon*, at about 3.5 Ga.

## Earliest life form
The earliest known life forms on Earth are putative fossilized microorganisms found in hydrothermal vent precipitates, considered to be about *3.42 billion years old*. The earliest time that life-forms first appeared on Earth is at least 3.77 billion years ago, possibly as early as 4.28 billion years, or even 4.41 billion years, not long after the oceans formed 4.5 billion years ago, and after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.

## Stone Age
The Stone Age was a broad prehistoric period during which stone was widely used to make tools with an edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted for roughly 3.4 million years, and ended 4,000 BCE ~ 2,000 BCE, with the advent of metalworking.

## Common era
2022 CE = AD 2022, but 400 BCE = 400 BC

## Prehistory
Prehistory, or pre-literary history, is the period of human history between the use of the first stone tools by hominins, some 3.3 million years ago, and the beginning of recorded history with the invention of writing systems. The use of symbols, marks, and images appears very early among humans, but the **earliest known writing systems appeared 5,000 years ago** and it took thousands of years for writing systems to be widely adopted.

## Aeon
The word _aeon_ /ˈiːɒn/, or `æon` (`Æon`), originally meant "life", "vital force" or "being", "generation" or "a period of time", though it tended to be translated as "age" in the sense of "ages", "forever", "timeless" or "for eternity". It is a Latin transliteration from the koine Greek word `ὁ αἰών` (ho aion), from the archaic `αἰϝών` (aiwon). In Homer it typically refers to life or lifespan.

Its latest meaning is more or less similar to the Sanskrit word `kalpa` and Hebrew word `olam`. A cognate Latin word `aevum` or `aeuum` (cf. `αἰϝών`) for "age" is present in words such as 'longevity' and 'mediaeval'. Its more common usage today is for any long, indefinite time span.

"Aeon" can also refer to **the 4 aeons** on the *geological time scale* that make up the Earth's history: _Hadean_, _Archean_, _Proterozoic_, _Phanerozoic_ (the current aeon).

In astronomy, an aeon is defined as a billion years (10⁹ years), abbreviated as `AE`), 1 AE = 10⁹ years = 1e9 years. Roger Penrose uses the word "aeon" to describe the period between successive and cyclic Big Bangs within the context of conformal cyclic cosmology.
