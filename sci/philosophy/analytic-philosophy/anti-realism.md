# anti-realism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism

In analytic philosophy, **anti-realism** is a position which encompasses many varieties such as metaphysical, mathematical, semantic, scientific, moral and epistemic.

The term was first articulated by British philosopher *Michael Dummett* in an argument against a form of realism Dummett saw as *colorless reductionism*.

In anti-realism, the truth of a statement rests on its demonstrability through internal logic mechanisms, such as the *context principle* or intuitionistic logic, in direct opposition to the realist notion that the truth of a statement rests on its *correspondence to an external, independent reality*. In anti-realism, this *external reality is hypothetical* and is not assumed.

Anti-realism, in its most general sense, can be understood as being in contrast to a *generic realism*, which holds that distinctive objects of a subject-matter exist and have properties independent of one's beliefs and conceptual schemes.

The ways in which anti-realism rejects these type of claims can vary dramatically. Because this encompasses statements containing abstract ideal objects (i.e. mathematical objects), anti-realism may apply to a wide range of philosophical topics, from material objects to the theoretical entities of science, mathematical statement, mental states, events and processes, the past and the future.
