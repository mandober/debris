https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics

>Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that studies the fundamental nature of reality; the first principles of being, identity and change, space and time, cause and effect, necessity and possibility.

Metaphysics is considered one of the 4 main branches of philosophy, along with epistemology, logic, and ethics.

Metaphysics includes questions about the nature of consciousness and the relationship between mind and matter, between substance and attribute, and between potentiality and actuality.

The word "metaphysics" comes from the Greek word metaphysika, meaning "after the Physics" in reference to works that are studied after the study of Physics.

Thirteenth century CE Italian philosopher Thomas Aquinas understood Metaphysics to refer to the chronological or pedagogical order among philosophical studies, with "metaphysical sciences" referring to "those that we study after having mastered the sciences that deal with the physical world".

Metaphysics studies questions related to what it is for something to exist and what types of existence are there.

Metaphysics seeks to answer, in an abstract and fully general manner, the questions of: "What is *it* that exists"; and "What *it* is like".
