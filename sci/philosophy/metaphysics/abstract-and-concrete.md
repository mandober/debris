# Abstract and concrete

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_and_concrete

In metaphysics, the distinction between abstract and concrete refers to a divide between two types of entities. Many philosophers hold that this difference has fundamental metaphysical significance.

Examples of *concrete objects* include plants, human beings and planets while things like numbers, sets and propositions are *abstract objects*.

There is no general consensus as to what the characteristic marks of concreteness and abstractness are.

Popular suggestions include defining the distinction in terms of the difference between
1. existence inside or outside space-time
2. having causes and effects or not
3. having contingent or necessary existence
4. being particular or universal
5. belonging to either the physical, or the mental realm, or to neither

Despite this diversity of views, there is broad agreement concerning most objects as to whether they are abstract or concrete.

Under most interpretations, all these views would agree that, for example, plants are concrete objects, while numbers are abstract objects.

Abstract objects are most commonly used in philosophy and semantics. They are sometimes called *abstracta* in contrast to *concreta*.

**Abstract object theory** is a discipline that studies the nature and role of abstract objects. It holds that properties can be related to objects in two ways: *through exemplification and through encoding*.

Concrete objects exemplify their properties, while abstract objects merely encode them. This approach is also known as the *dual copula strategy*.
