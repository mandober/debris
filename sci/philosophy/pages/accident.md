# Accident

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident

Accident is a property that the entity has contingently, without which it still retains its identity. Accident is contrasted with essence, which is the property that makes an entity fundamentally what it is, which it has by necessity, without which it loses its identity.
