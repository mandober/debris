Epistemology, from Ancient Greek `ἐπιστήμη` (epistḗmē) 'knowledge', and -logy)

*Epistemology* or *the theory of knowledge* is the branch of philosophy concerned with all aspects of knowledge.

Epistemology is considered a major subfield of philosophy, along with ethics, logic and metaphysics.

Epistemologists study the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge, epistemic justification, the rationality of belief, and various related issues. Debates in epistemology are generally clustered around four core areas:


The philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge, such as truth and justification
Potential sources of knowledge and justified belief, such as perception, reason, memory, and testimony
The structure of a body of knowledge or justified belief, including whether all justified beliefs must be derived from justified foundational beliefs or whether justification requires only a coherent set of beliefs
Philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility of knowledge, and related problems, such as whether skepticism poses a threat to our ordinary knowledge claims and whether it is possible to refute skeptical arguments
In these debates and others, epistemology aims to answer questions such as "What do people know?", "What does it mean to say that people know something?", "What makes justified beliefs justified?", and "How do people know that they know?"

Specialties in epistemology ask questions such as "How can people create formal models about issues related to knowledge?" (in formal epistemology), "What are the historical conditions of changes in different kinds of knowledge?" (in historical epistemology), "What are the methods, aims, and subject matter of epistemological inquiry?" (in metaepistemology), and "How do people know together?" (in social epistemology).

# Epistemology

**Epistemology**, or the *theory of knowledge*, is the study of the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge and *epistemic justification*. Epistemology is concerned with *knowledge* that forms the foundation of human understanding.

*Epistemic justification* is the property of belief that qualifies it as knowledge rather than mere opinion. Epistemology is the study of reasons that someone holds a rationally admissible belief. Epistemologists are concerned with various epistemic features of *belief*, which include the ideas of *warrant* (a proper justification for holding a belief), knowledge, rationality, probability.

Epistemology is considered a major subfield of philosophy, along with ethics, logic and metaphysics.

The central questions of epistemology:
- What is knowledge?
- How do we know what is true and what is not?
- How do we know that we even know something?

Debates in epistemology are generally clustered around 4 core issues:
- Philosophical analysis of the *nature of knowledge* and the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge, such as truth and justification.
- Potential *sources of knowledge* and justified belief, such as perception, reason, memory, and testimony.
- The *structure of a body of knowledge* or justified belief, including whether all justified beliefs must be derived from justified foundational beliefs or whether justification requires only a coherent set of beliefs.
- *Philosophical skepticism*, which questions the possibility of knowledge, and related problems, such as whether skepticism poses a threat to our ordinary knowledge claims and whether it is possible to refute skeptical arguments.

The scope of propositional knowledge is broad so we need a general characterization of knowledge we can apply to any situation. Traditional epistemologists generally agree that propositional knowledge has 3 core parts: belief, truth and justification.

- definition
  - Epistemology is the study of the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge and epistemic justification.
- etymology
  - `ἐπιστήμη` (epistḗmē) 'knowledge', and `λoγoϛ`
- two jobs of epistemology
  1. Determining the nature of knowledge. What is it? How do we distinguish between someone who knows something and someone who fails to know something?
  2. Determining the extent of what we can know. How do we acquire knowledge, and are there limits to what can be known?
- What is knowledge?
  - Knowledge, simply put, is a type of *cognitive success*. More specifically, it's understanding of something, which may include objects (called *acquaintance knowledge* or knowing by acquaintance) skills (called *procedural knowledge* or knowing-how) and facts (called *propositional knowledge* or knowing-that).
- Propositional knowledge
  - `knowing-that` type of knowledge, e.g. claims, facts, propositions:
  - 'Cats are mammals', '2 + 2 = 42', 'Triangles have 3 sides'
  - The scope of propositional knowledge is broad so we need a general characterization of knowledge we can apply to any situation.
  - Traditional epistemologists generally agree that propositional knowledge has 3 core parts: belief, truth and justification.
- Ways to gain knowledge
  - possible ways we may gain knowledge include:
    1) perception 2) introspection 3) memory 4) testimony 5) reason
- a priori vs a posteriori
- empiricists vs rationalists
  - empiricists believe that all knowledge is ultimately grounded in experience
  - rationalists believe it is grounded in reason
- belief
  - belief is an acceptance that a statement is true or that something exists.
  - e.g. to accept the truth of the proposition "the sky is blue," one must first believe that the sky is blue.
  - If one has no beliefs about a particular matter, one cannot have knowledge about it.
- truth
  - truth is the idea that one's beliefs are in accordance with reality or objective facts. To acquire true knowledge is to increase one's true beliefs and decrease false beliefs. If one can't acquire truths at all, then one has no knowledge. However, not all true beliefs constitute knowledge. Pritchard argued we can simply be epistemically lucky.
- problem of epistemic luck
  - having an unjustified belief, by chance, which turns out true.
  - John is a hypochondriac and believes he has a terminal illness. However, his doctor soon finds out that he indeed has a fatal illness. John was right, but it was simply "epistemic luck".
- justification
  - knowledge needs justification, the reasons why one holds their believes.
  - Only true beliefs arrived at in the right way are considered knowledge.
  - many philosophers up until the XX century believed that justified true belief (JTB) is accurate description of the nature of knowledge. But then Edmond Gettier published his seminal 1963 paper "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?" arguing that luck still plays a role in knowledge despite JTB.
- Gettier problems
  - Gettier cases show that JTB is not true knowledge
  - e.g. Suppose a public clock breaks, freezing at 11:59 PM. 12 hours later, a student glances at it and forms a belief that it's 11:59 AM. His belief is true since the time is indeed 11:59 AM, and is justified.
  - To solve Gettier's issues, we need to understand what justification is, specifically its nature and structure.
- nature and structure of justification
  - One of the most important aspects of deciding the nature of justification is to consider if it should depend on factors solely in one's mind or consider external factors.
- internalism
  - Internalism is the belief that justification depends solely on factors internal to the believer's mind.
  - internalist's justification depends just on factors in one's mind, but this raises the question of how these factors, and knowledge, are structured?
- externalism
  - states factors outside of just psychological ones, such as perception, can be conditions of justification.
  - The most significant externalist theory of justification is called *reliabilism*, put forth by philosopher Alvin Goldman in the 1960s. According to which a true belief counts as knowledge only if a reliable belief-forming process produces it. This may include standard perceptual processes, remembering, good reasoning, and introspection.
- foundationalism vs coherentism
  - internalist theories of justification
  - *Coherentism* is the theory that justification is a relation of mutual support among many beliefs.
  - *Foundationalism*, on the other hand, states that certain beliefs can be based on other beliefs.
- epistemological skepticism
  - epistemological skepticism is the view that we cannot know anything, or at least that we do not know as much as we think we do.
  - *Pyrrhonism* associated with the philosopher Pyrrho involves skepticism that states we can't know anything, including if we can know anything.
  - *Academic skepticism* dating from around 266 BCE associated by Carneades that states that the only thing we know is that we know nothing.
- regress problem
  - Regress Problem, aka Agrippa's Trilemma, attributed to the ancient Pyrronist skeptic Agrippa, says that any proposition supported by a belief can be infinitely questioned, resulting in an infinite regress of beliefs.
- Cartesian skepticism
  - cogito ergo sum
  - The modern version of this is *brain in a vat* that is fed data that makes it seem like we exist and live in a reality.
- Humean skepticism
  - David Hume showed with Humean Skepticism how if one were to show a way to trust our perceptions clearly, it still wouldn't be enough to defeat epistemological skepticism.
  - numerical vs qualitative identity
  - We all think the external world is stable, and we believe various things we see persist throughout the day. The moon is still there even if no one's looking at it.
  - Hume thinks arguments that justify it is so often suffer from an equivocation fallacy.
  - principle of the uniformity of nature; problem of induction
- do we know anything then?
- mitigated skepticism
  - Hume's idea that we'll never know anything 100%, but perhaps we can have partial knowledge of things while still remaining open minded and skeptical.
- Bayesian epistemology
  - Bayesian Epistemology which uses this idea of partial knowledge.
  - Based on Thomas Bayes' work in probability theory, instead of having fixed beliefs about propositions, with Bayesian Epistemology we are constantly updating our beliefs as probabilities depending on evidence and context.
