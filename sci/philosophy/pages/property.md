# Property

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(philosophy)

In logic and philosophy (especially metaphysics), 
>a property is a characteristic of an object

For example, a red object is said to have the property of redness.

The property may be considered a form of object in its own right, able to possess other properties. 

A property, however, differs from individual objects in that it *may be instantiated*, and often in more than one object. 

A property differs from the logical or mathematical concept of class by *not having any concept of extensionality*.

A property differs from the philosophical concept of class in that 
>a property is considered to be distinct from the objects which possess it.

Understanding how different individual entities (or particulars) can in some sense have some of the same properties is the basis of *the problem of universals*.
