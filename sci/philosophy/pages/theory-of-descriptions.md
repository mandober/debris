# Theory of descriptions
(philosophy, logic, linguistic, semantics)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_descriptions

*Theory of descriptions* was initially put forward by Bertrand Russell in his 1905's essay "On denoting". Russell's theory is focused on the logical form of expressions involving *denoting phrases*, which he divides into 3 groups:
- denoting phrases which do not denote anything
- denoting phrases which denote a single definite object
- denoting phrases which denote ambiguously


1. Denoting phrases which do not denote anything.

For example "the current Emperor of Kentucky".

2. Phrases which denote one definite object.

For example "the current president of the USA".

We need not know which object the phrase refers to for it to be unambiguous. For example "the cutest kitten" is a unique individual, even though their actual identity is unknown.

3. Phrases which denote ambiguously.

For example "an Aardvark".

*Indefinite descriptions* constitute Russell's third group. 
Descriptions most frequently appear in the standard subject-predicate form.


Russell conceived his theory of descriptions to solve a number of problems in the *philosophy of language*, the two major problems of which are:
1. co-referring expressions
2. non-referring expressions


The problem of **co-referring expressions** originated primarily with Gottlob Frege as the problem of *informative identities*.

>example: "The morning star" and "The evening star"

A famous example is "the morning star" and "the evening star" as the two denotations for the same planet, Venus, seen at different times of day.

The question is how is it that someone can think that the morning star rises in the morning but the evening star does not?

This is problematic because although the two expressions seem to denote the same thing, we *cannot substitute one for the other*, which we should be able to do with identical or synonymous expressions.


The problem of **non-referring expressions** is that certain expressions that are meaningful do not truly refer to anything.

>example: "Any dog is annoying"

This can be formalized as `∃x(Dx ⋀ Ax)`. However, that is not the intention of this somewhat uncommon expression. It is not meant that there is a particular individual dog, namely any dog, that has the property of being annoying. Rather, it means that all dogs are annoying, formalized as `∀x(Dx -> Ax)`. Similar considerations apply for "some dog", "every dog", "a dog", etc.

>example: "The current king of France is bold"
>example: "The current Emperor of Kentucky is gray"

This expression does not meant that there is some individual, namely the current Emperor of Kentucky, who has the property of being gray; Kentucky was never a monarchy, so there is no Emperor at all.

Russell wants to avoid admitting mysterious nonexistent objects into his theory.

Furthermore, the Law of Excluded Middle requires that one of the propositions must be true:
- either, "the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray"
- or, "it is not the case that the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray"

>Normally, propositions of the subject-predicate form are said to be true iff the subject is in the extension of the predicate.

But, there is currently no emperor of Kentucky. So, *since the subject does not exist (fails to refer), it is not in the extension of either predicate*. That is, it is not in the set of gray people, nor in the set of non-gray people.

Thus, it appears that this is a case in which the law of excluded middle is violated, which may also be an indication that something has gone wrong.
