# Truth-bearer

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth-bearer

A **truth-bearer** is an entity that is said to be either true or false and nothing else.

The thesis that some things are true while others are false has led to different theories about the nature of these entities. 

Since there is divergence of opinion on the matter, the term truth-bearer is used to be neutral among the various theories. 

Truth-bearer candidates include
- propositions
- sentences
- sentence-tokens
- statements
- beliefs
- thoughts
- intuitions
- utterances
- judgements

but different authors
- exclude one or more of these,
- deny their existence,
- argue that they are true only in a derivative sense,
- assert or assume that the terms are synonymous,
- or seek to avoid addressing their distinction or do not clarify it.

## Introduction

Some distinctions and terminology as used in this article, based on Wolfram 1989 (Chapter 2 Section1) follow. It should be understood that the terminology described is not always used in the ways set out, and it is introduced solely for the purposes of discussion in this article. Use is made of the *type-token* and *use-mention* distinctions. Reflection on occurrences of numerals might be helpful. In grammar a sentence can be a declaration, an explanation, a question, a command. In logic a declarative sentence is considered to be a sentence that can be used to communicate truth. Some sentences which are grammatically declarative are not logically so.

A character[nb 1] is a typographic character (printed or written) etc.

A word-token[nb 2] is a pattern of characters. A word-type[nb 3] is an identical pattern of characters. A meaningful-word-token[nb 4] is a meaningful pattern of characters. Two word-tokens which mean the same are of the same word-meaning[nb 5]

A sentence-token[nb 6] is a pattern of word-tokens. A meaningful-sentence-token[nb 7] is a meaningful sentence-token or a meaningful pattern of meaningful-word-tokens. Two sentence-tokens are of the same sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters[nb 8] A declarative-sentence-token is a sentence-token which that can be used to communicate truth or convey information.[nb 9] A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is a meaningful declarative-sentence-token[nb 10] Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type[nb 11] if they are identical patterns of word-tokens. A nonsense-declarative-sentence-token[nb 12] is a declarative-sentence-token which is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token. A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use[nb 13] occurs when and only when a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is used declaratively.

A referring-expression[nb 14] is expression that can be used to pick out or refer to particular entity. A referential success[nb 15] is a referring-expression's success in identifying a particular entity. A referential failure[nb 16] is a referring-expression's failure to identify a particular entity. A referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use[nb 17] is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use containing no referring-expression that fails to identify a particular entity.
