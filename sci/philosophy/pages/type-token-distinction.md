# Type-token distinction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-token_distinction

>The **type-token distinction** is the difference between naming a class (type) of objects and naming the individual instances (tokens) of that class.

Since each type may be exemplified by multiple tokens, there are generally more tokens than types of an object. 

For example, the sentence "A rose is a rose is a rose" contains 3 *word types*:
- 3 word tokens of the type `a`
- 3 word tokens of the type `rose`
- 2 word tokens of the type `is`

The distinction is important in disciplines such as logic, linguistics, metalogic, typography and computer programming.

For example, "an integer" may refer to the type of integral numbers (the class itself, the type), or to an arbitrary number (a member of the class, a token) of that type.

## Overview

>The type-token distinction separates **types** - abstract descriptive concepts - from **tokens** - objects that instantiate concepts.

For example, in the sentence "the bicycle is becoming more popular" the word "bicycle" represents the abstract concept of bicycles and is thus a *type*, whereas in the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage", "it" represents a particular object and is therefore a *token*.

Similarly, the *word type* 'letter' uses only 4 *letter types*: L, E, T and R. Nevertheless, it uses both E and T twice. One can say that the word type 'letter' has 6 *letter tokens*, with 2 tokens each of the letter types E and T.

Whenever a word type is inscribed, the number of *letter tokens* created equals the number of *letter occurrences* in the *word type*.

Some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members.

The distinction in OOP between classes and objects is related, though in this context, "class" sometimes refers to a set of objects (with class-level attribute or operations) rather than a description of an object in the set, as "type" would.

## Typography

In typography, the type-token distinction is used to determine the presence of a text printed by movable type (system of printing with movable components to reproduce the elements of a document):

The defining criteria which a typographic print has to fulfill is that of the *type identity* of the various letter forms which make up the printed text. In other words: each letter form which appears in the text has to be shown as a particular instance ("token") of one and the same type which contains a reverse image of the printed letter.

## Charles Sanders Peirce

The distinctions between using words as types or tokens were first made by American logician and philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce in 1906 using terminology that he established.

Peirce's type-token distinction applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, etc.; to anything in a universe of discourse of *character-string theory*, or *concatenation theory*.

In Peirce's words:

A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about 20 "the"s on a page, and, of course, they count as 20 words. In another sense of the word "word", however, there is but one word "the" in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page, or be heard in any voice. For such a *Form*, I propose to term a `Type`. A *Single Object* such as this word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a `Token`.
>In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies.

-- Peirce 1906 (also Ogden and Richards, 1923, 280-1)
