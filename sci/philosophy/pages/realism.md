# Realism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism

*Philosophical realism* is usually not treated as a position of its own but as a stance towards other subject matters.

Realism about a certain kind of thing (like numbers or morality) is the thesis that this kind of thing has mind-independent existence, i.e. that it is not just a mere appearance in the eye of the beholder.

This includes a number of positions within *epistemology* and *metaphysics* which express that a given thing instead exists *independently of knowledge, thought, or understanding*.

>**Mathematical realism** holds that the existence of mathematical objects is independent of the mind (knowledge, thought, understanding).

This can apply to items such as the physical world, the past and future, other minds, and the self, though may also apply less directly to things such as universals, mathematical truths, moral truths, and thought itself. However, realism may also include various positions which instead reject metaphysical treatments of reality entirely.

Realism can also be a view about the properties of reality in general, holding that reality exists independent of the mind, as opposed to non-realist views (like some forms of skepticism and solipsism) which question the certainty of anything beyond one's own mind. 

Philosophers who profess realism often claim that truth consists in a correspondence between cognitive representations and reality.

>Realists tend to believe that whatever we believe now is only an approximation of reality but that the accuracy and fullness of understanding can be improved.

In some contexts, realism is contrasted with idealism.

Today it is more usually contrasted with *anti-realism*, for example in the philosophy of science.

The oldest use of the term "realism" appears in medieval scholastic interpretations and adaptations of ancient Greek philosophy.
