# Nominalism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism

In metaphysics,
>**nominalism** is the view that *universals* and *abstract objects* do not actually exist other than being merely names or labels.

>**Mathematical realism** holds that the existence of mathematical objects do not actually exist other than being merely names or labels.

There are at least two main versions of nominalism.
- One version denies the existence of universals - things that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things (e.g. strength, humanity)
- The other version specifically denies the existence of abstract objects - objects that do not exist in space and time

Most nominalists have held that only physical particulars in space and time are real, and that universals exist only *post res*, that is, subsequent to particular things.

However, some versions of nominalism hold that some particulars are *abstract entities* (e.g. numbers), while others are *concrete entities* - entities that do exist in space and time (e.g. pillars, snakes, bananas).

Nominalism is primarily a position on the **problem of universals**.

Nominalism is opposed to realism and realist philosophies, such as *Platonic realism*, which assert that universals do exist over and above particulars, and to the hylomorphic substance theory of Aristotle, which asserts that universals are immanently real within them.

The name "nominalism" emerged from debates in medieval philosophy with Roscellinus. The term "nominalism" stems from the Latin 'nomen', meaning "name". John Stuart Mill summarised nominalism in the apothegm *"there is nothing general except names"*.
