aka
- Theory of being
- Theory of categories

In ontology, 
the theory of categories concerns itself with the *categories of being*: the highest *genera* (s. genus) or *kinds of entities* according to Amie Thomasson.

* Categories - The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (from Jan 2021)
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/categories/

>To investigate the categories of being, or simply categories, is to determine the most fundamental and the broadest *classes of entities*.

A distinction between such categories, in making the categories or applying them, is called an **ontological distinction**.

Various systems of categories have been proposed, often including categories for
- substances
- properties
- relations
- states of affairs
- events

A representative question within the theory of categories might articulate itself, for example, in a query like:
>"Are universals prior to particulars?"
