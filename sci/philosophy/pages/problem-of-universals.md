# Problem of universals

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_universals

The problem of universals is an ancient question from metaphysics that has inspired a range of philosophical topics and disputes:

>Should the properties an object has in common with other objects, such as color and shape, be considered to exist beyond those objects?

>And if a property exists separately from objects, what is the nature of that existence?

The problem of universals relates to various inquiries closely related to metaphysics, logic, and epistemology, as far back as Plato and Aristotle, 
>in efforts to define the mental connections humans make when they understand a property such as shape or color to be the same in nonidentical objects.

Universals are qualities or relations found in two or more entities.

As an example, if all cup holders are circular in some way, circularity may be considered a universal property of cup holders. Further, if two daughters can be considered female offspring of Frank, the qualities of being female, offspring, and of Frank, are universal properties of the two daughters. Many properties can be universal: being human, red, male, female, liquid, solid, big, small, etc.

Philosophers agree that we can talk and think about universals, but disagree on *whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech*.
