# State of affairs

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_affairs_(philosophy)

In philosophy, a **state of affairs** (German: *Sachverhalt*), also known as a *situation*, is a way the actual world must be in order to make some given proposition about the actual world's truth; in other words, a state of affairs is a truth-maker, whereas a proposition is a truth-bearer.

Whereas states of affairs either obtain or fail-to-obtain, propositions are either true or false.

Some philosophers understand the term "states of affairs" in a more restricted sense as a synonym for "fact". In this sense, there are no states of affairs that do not obtain.

David Malet Armstrong is well known for his defence of a *factualism*, a position according to which the world is a world of facts and not a world of things.
