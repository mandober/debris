# Object

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)

The distinction between subject and object is a basic idea of philosophy.

A **subject** is a being that
- exercises agency,
- undergoes conscious experiences,
- is situated in relation to other things that exist outside itself
thus, a subject is any individual, person, or observer.

An **object** is any of the things observed or experienced by a subject, which may even include other beings (thus, from their own points of view: other subjects; subjects as objects).


A simple common differentiation for subject and object is: 
>an observer versus a thing that is observed.

In certain cases involving *personhood*, subjects and objects can be considered interchangeable where each label is applied only from one or the other point of view.

Subjects and objects are related to the philosophical *distinction between subjectivity and objectivity*: the existence of knowledge, ideas, information, either
- dependent upon a subject (subjectivity), or
- independent from any subject (objectivity)
