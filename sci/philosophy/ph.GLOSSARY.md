## Accident
Accident is a property that the entity has contingently, without which it still retains its identity. Accident is contrasted with essence, which is the property that makes an entity fundamentally what it is, which it has by necessity, without which it loses its identity. 

## Analytic-synthetic distinction
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic-synthetic_distinction

The analytic-synthetic dichotomy is a semantic distinction, used primarily in philosophy to distinguish propositions into two types: analytic propositions and synthetic propositions. Analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.

## Anti-psychologism
In logic, anti-psychologism (aka *logical objectivism* or *logical realism*) is a theory about the *nature of logical truth*, that it does not depend upon the contents of human ideas but exists independent of human ideas.


## Axiology
Axiology is the philosophical study of value. It is either the collective term for ethics and aesthetics, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to value theory and meta-ethics.

## Classical logic
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_logic

Classical logic (standard logic or Frege-Russell logic) is the intensively studied and most widely used class of deductive logic. Classical logic has had much influence on analytic philosophy.

Each logical system in this class shares characteristic properties such as
- The law of excluded middle (LEM)
- Double negation elimination (DNE)
- The law of noncontradiction (LNC)
- The principle of explosion (EFQ)
- Monotonicity of entailment
- Idempotency of entailment
- Commutativity of conjunction
- De Morgan duality: every logical operator is dual to another
- The bivalence of truth: most semantics of classical logic are bivalent

While not entailed by the preceding conditions, contemporary discussions of classical logic normally only include propositional and first-order logics. In other words, the overwhelming majority of time spent studying classical logic has been spent studying specifically propositional and first-order logic, as opposed to the other forms of classical logic.

## Description
Description is the pattern of narrative development that aims to invoke a certain sentiment. A description of something (of an object, person, event, etc.) is an account presenting characteristics and aspects of the thing being described in sufficient detail, so that the audience can form a mental picture, impression, or develop an understanding of it. Description is one of the *4 rhetorical modes*, along with *exposition*, *argumentation* and *narration*.

## Definite description
A definite description is a denoting phrase of the form "the X", where X is a noun-phrase or a singular common noun. If X applies to a unique individual or object, then it is a **proper definite description**; otherwise, it is improper.

For example, "the first man in space" and "the 42nd President of the USA", are both proper descriptions, as opposed to "the person in space" and "the Senator from Ohio", which are improper because the noun phrase X applies to more than one thing. The definite descriptions "the first man on Saturn" and "the Senator from some Country" are improper because X doesn't apply to anything. Improper descriptions raise some difficult questions about the law of excluded middle, denotation, modality, and mental content.

## Determiner
A determiner is a word, phrase or affix that occurs together with a noun phrase and serves to express the reference of that noun phrase in the context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc. Common kinds of determiners in English include definite (the) and indefinite articles (a/an), demonstratives (this, that), possessives (my, their), cardinal numerals, quantifiers (many, both, all, no), distributives (each, any), interrogatives (which).

## Deviant logics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviant_logics

Deviant logics, in contrast to extended logics, reject some of the fundamental principles of classical logic and are often seen as its rivals.

*Intuitionistic logic* is based on the idea that truth depends on verification through a proof. This leads it to reject certain rules of inference found in classical logic that are not compatible with this assumption.

*Free logic* modifies classical logic in order to avoid existential presuppositions associated with the use of possibly empty singular terms, like names and definite descriptions. 

*Many-valued logics* allow additional truth values besides true and false. They thereby reject the principle of bivalence of truth. 

*Paraconsistent logics* are logical systems able to deal with contradictions. They do so by avoiding the principle of explosion found in classical logic.

*Relevance logic* is a prominent form of paraconsistent logic. It rejects the purely truth-functional interpretation of the material conditional by introducing the additional requirement of relevance: for the conditional to be true, its antecedent has to be relevant to its consequent.

## Epistemology
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology

Epistemology (ἐπιστήμη :: epistḗmē :: knowledge) or the Theory of Knowledge, is the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge.

Epistemology is considered a major subfield of philosophy, along with other major subfields such as ethics, logic, and metaphysics.

Epistemologists study the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge, epistemic justification, the rationality of belief, and various related issues.

Debates in epistemology are generally clustered around 4 core areas:
1. The philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge, such as truth and justification;
2. Potential sources of knowledge and justified belief, such as perception, reason, memory, and testimony;
3. The structure of a body of knowledge or justified belief, including whether all justified beliefs must be derived from justified foundational beliefs or whether justification requires only a coherent set of beliefs;
4. Philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility of knowledge, and related problems, such as whether skepticism poses a threat to our ordinary knowledge claims and whether it is possible to refute skeptical arguments.

Epistemology aims to answer questions such as: What do we know?, What does it mean to say that we know something?, What makes justified beliefs justified?, How do we know that we know?

## Essence
Essence is the property that makes an entity what it fundamentally is, which it has by necessity, without which it loses its identity. Essence is contrasted with accident, which is a property that the entity has contingently, without which it still retains its identity.

## Extended logics
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_logics

Extended logics are logical systems that are based on classical logic and its rules of inference, but extend it to new fields by introducing new logical symbols and the corresponding rules of inference governing these symbols.

In the case of *alethic modal logic*, these new symbols are used to express not just what is true simpliciter, but also what is possibly or necessarily true.

It is often combined with *possible worlds semantics*, which holds that a proposition is possibly true if it is true in some possible world while it is necessarily true if it is true in all possible worlds.


*Deontic logic* pertains to ethics and provides a formal treatment of ethical notions, such as obligation and permission.

*Temporal logic* formalizes temporal relations between propositions. This includes ideas like whether something is true at some time or all the time and whether it is true in the future or in the past.

*Epistemic logic* belongs to epistemology. It can be used to express not just what is the case but also what someone believes or knows to be the case. Its rules of inference articulate what follows from the fact that someone has these kinds of mental states.

*Higher-order logics* do not directly apply classical logic to certain new sub-fields within philosophy but generalize it by allowing quantification not just over individuals but also over predicates.

## Extremal clause
The clause in a recursive definition that specifies that no items other than those generated by the stated rules fall within the definition; e.g. 0 is an natural number; if n is a natural number then S(n) is a natural number, "and nothing else is a natural number".

## Existence
Existence is the ability of an entity to interact with reality. In philosophy, it refers to the ontological property of being.

## Fallacy
In reasoning to argue a claim, a fallacy is reasoning that is evaluated as logically incorrect and that undermines the logical validity of the argument and permits its recognition as unsound.

## Logic
Logic can be defined as the study of valid inference.

## Logical atomism
The theory holds that the world consists of ultimate logical "facts" (or "atoms") that cannot be broken down any further, each of which can be understood independently of other facts. Having originally propounded this stance in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Wittgenstein rejected it in his later Philosophical Investigations. The term was first coined by Russell in 1911, its main proponent. However, logical atomism has older roots. Russell referred to his atomistic doctrine as contrary to the tier "of the people who more or less follow Hegel". The first principle of logical atomism is that the World contains "facts". The facts are complex structures consisting of objects ("particulars"). A fact may be that an object has a property or that it stands in some relation to other objects. In addition, there are judgments ("beliefs"), which are in a relationship to the facts, and by this relationship either true or false. According to this theory, even ordinary objects of daily life "are apparently complex entities". According to Russell, words like "this" and "that" are used to denote particulars. In contrast, ordinary names such as "Socrates" actually are definitive descriptions. In the analysis of "Plato talks with his pupils", "Plato" needs to be replaced with something like "the man who was the teacher of Aristotle". Russell's theory of descriptions was crucial to logical atomism, as Russell believed that language mirrored reality.

## Logical holism
In Philosophy, logical holism is the belief that the world operates in such a way that no part can be known without the whole being known first. This belief is related to monism, and is associated with the absolute idealism which was dominant in Britain at the time. Logical atomism can be understood as a developed alternative to logical holism, or the "monistic logic" of the absolute idealists.

## Noumenon
Noumenon is a posited object or event that exists independently of human sense or perception. Noumenon is contrasted with phenomenon, which refers to anything that can be apprehended by (or is an object of) the senses.

## Objectivism
Objectivism is a philosophical system created by Ayn Rand that declares real knowledge to be metaphysically objective. *Moral objectivism* or *moral realism*, the meta-ethical position that ethical sentences express factual propositions about robust or mind-independent features of the world, and that some such propositions are true. *Anti-psychologism* or *logical objectivism* is the conviction that the rules of logic are mind-independent.

## Phenomenon
The term "phenomenon" refers to anything that can be apprehended by (or is an object of) the senses. Phenomenon is contrasted with noumenon, which is a posited object or event that exists independently of human sense or perception.

## Psychologism
Psychologism is a family of philosophical positions, according to which certain psychological notions play a central role in grounding or explaining certain non-psychological notions.

The view or doctrine that a theory of psychology or ideas forms the basis of an account of metaphysics, epistemology, or meaning. (spec.) The explanation or derivation of mathematical or logical laws in terms of psychological facts.

## Philosophical logic
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_logic

Philosophical logic refers to those areas of philosophy in which recognized methods of logic are used to advance the discussion of philosophical problems. Philosophical logic is the area of logic that studies the application of logical methods to philosophical problems, often in the form of extended logical systems like modal logic. Among these are the study of argument and meaning, but also of identity, existence, predication, necessity and truth. Philosophical logic also addresses extensions and alternatives to traditional classical logics, known as non-classical logics.

Philosophical logic forms one field of inquiry within the philosophy of logic. An important issue for philosophical logic is the question of how to classify the great variety of non-classical logical systems, many of which have recent origin.

One form of classification is to distinguish between *extended logics* (alethic modal logic, deontic modal logic, temporal logic, epistemic logic, etc.) and *deviant logics* (intuitionistic logic, free logic, many-valued logic, paraconsistent logics, etc.).


## Philosophy of language
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language

In analytic philosophy, philosophy of language investigates the nature of language and the relations between language, language users, and the world.

Investigations may include inquiry into the nature of meaning, intentionality, reference, the constitution of sentences, concepts, learning, and thought.

Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell were pivotal figures in analytic philosophy's "linguistic turn". They were followed by Ludwig Wittgenstein (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus), the Vienna Circle, logical positivists, and Willard Van Orman Quine.

In continental philosophy, language is not studied as a separate discipline. Rather, it is an inextricable part of many other areas of thought, such as phenomenology, structural semiotics, language of mathematics, hermeneutics, existentialism, deconstruction and critical theory.

## Theory of descriptions
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_descriptions

The Theory of Descriptions (aka Russell's Theory of Descriptions, RTD) is the Bertrand Russell's most significant contribution to the philosophy of language.

In short, Russell argued that the syntactic form of descriptions (phrases that took the form of "The aardvark" and "An aardvark") is misleading, as it does not correlate their logical and/or semantic architecture. While descriptions may seem fairly uncontroversial phrases, Russell argued that providing a satisfactory analysis of the linguistic and logical properties of a description is vital to clarity in important philosophical debates, particularly in semantic arguments, epistemology and metaphysical elements.

## Theology
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology

(τέλος :: telos :: end, aim, goal) Relating to the doctrine of design and purpose in the material world. Relating to or involving the explanation of phenomena in terms of the purpose they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise; e.g. "teleological narratives of progress".

Teleology or finality is a reason or an explanation for something which serves as a function of its end, its purpose, or its goal, as opposed to something which serves as a function of its cause. A purpose that is imposed by human use, such as the purpose of a fork to hold food, is called extrinsic.

## Telos
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos

"Telos" is a term used by Aristotle to refer to the final cause of a natural organ or entity, or of a work of human art. "Telos" is the root of the modern term "teleology", the study of purposiveness or of objects with a view to their aims, purposes, or intentions. Teleology, is central in Aristotle's work on plant and animal biology, and human ethics, through his theory of the 4 causes. Aristotle's notion that everything has a telos also gave rise to epistemology.
