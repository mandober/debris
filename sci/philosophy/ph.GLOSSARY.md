## Accident
Accident is a property that the entity has contingently, without which it still retains its identity. Accident is contrasted with essence, which is the property that makes an entity fundamentally what it is, which it has by necessity, without which it loses its identity. 

## Analytic-synthetic distinction
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic-synthetic_distinction

The analytic-synthetic dichotomy is a semantic distinction, used primarily in philosophy to distinguish propositions into two types: analytic propositions and synthetic propositions.
- *analytic propositions* are true by virtue of their meaning
- *synthetic propositions* are true by how their meaning relates to the world

## Anti-psychologism
In logic, anti-psychologism (aka *logical objectivism* or *logical realism*) is a theory about the *nature of logical truth*, that it does not depend upon the contents of human ideas but exists independent of human ideas.

## Axiology
Axiology is the philosophical study of value. It is either the collective term for ethics and aesthetics, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to value theory and meta-ethics.

## Class
A class is a collection whose members either fall under a predicate or are classified by a rule. Hence, while a set can be extensionally defined only by its elements, a class has also an intensional dimension that unites its members.

## Description
Description is the pattern of narrative development that aims to invoke a certain sentiment. A description of something (of an object, person, event, etc.) is an account presenting characteristics and aspects of the thing being described in sufficient detail, so that the audience can form a mental picture, impression, or develop an understanding of it. Description is one of the *four rhetorical modes*, along with *exposition*, *argumentation* and *narration*.

## Definite description
A definite description is a denoting phrase of the form "the X", where X is a noun-phrase or a singular common noun. If X applies to a unique individual or object, then it is a *proper definite description*; otherwise, it is improper.

For example, "the first man in space" and "the 42nd President of the USA", are both proper descriptions, as opposed to "the person in space" and "the Senator from Ohio", which are improper because the noun phrase X applies to more than one thing. The definite descriptions "the first man on Saturn" and "the Senator from some Country" are improper because X doesn't apply to anything. Improper descriptions raise some difficult questions about the law of excluded middle, denotation, modality, and mental content.

## Determiner
A determiner is a word, phrase or affix that occurs together with a noun phrase and serves to express the reference of that noun phrase in the context. That is, a determiner may indicate whether the noun is referring to a definite or indefinite element of a class, to a closer or more distant element, to an element belonging to a specified person or thing, to a particular number or quantity, etc. Common kinds of determiners in English include definite (the) and indefinite articles (a/an), demonstratives (this, that), possessives (my, their), cardinal numerals, quantifiers (many, both, all, no), distributives (each, any), interrogatives (which).

## Epistemology
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology

Epistemology (ἐπιστήμη :: epistḗmē :: knowledge) or the Theory of Knowledge, is the branch of philosophy concerned with knowledge.

Epistemology is considered a major subfield of philosophy, along with other major subfields such as ethics, logic, and metaphysics.

Epistemologists study the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge, epistemic justification, the rationality of belief, and various related issues.

Debates in epistemology are generally clustered around 4 core areas:
1. The philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and the conditions required for a belief to constitute knowledge, such as truth and justification;
2. Potential sources of knowledge and justified belief, such as perception, reason, memory, and testimony;
3. The structure of a body of knowledge or justified belief, including whether all justified beliefs must be derived from justified foundational beliefs or whether justification requires only a coherent set of beliefs;
4. Philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility of knowledge, and related problems, such as whether skepticism poses a threat to our ordinary knowledge claims and whether it is possible to refute skeptical arguments.

Epistemology aims to answer questions such as: What do we know?, What does it mean to say that we know something?, What makes justified beliefs justified?, How do we know that we know?

## Essence
Essence is the property that makes an entity what it fundamentally is, which it has by necessity, without which it would loose its identity. Essence is contrasted with accident, which is a property that the entity has contingently, without which it still retains its identity.

## Existence
Existence is the ability of an entity to interact with reality. In philosophy, it refers to the ontological property of being.

## Fallacy
A fallacy is reasoning that is evaluated as logically incorrect, that undermines the logical validity of the argument and permits its recognition as unsound.

## Factualism
A position according to which the world is a world of facts and not a world of things. (David Malet Armstrong is well known for his defence of a factualism)

## Instantiation principle
or The Principle Of Exemplification is the concept in metaphysics and logic that there can be no uninstantiated or unexemplified properties or universals.In other words, it is impossible for a property to exist which is not had by some object.

## Logical atomism
The theory holds that the world consists of ultimate logical "facts" (or "atoms") that cannot be broken down any further, each of which can be understood independently of other facts. Having originally propounded this stance in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Wittgenstein rejected it in his later Philosophical Investigations. The term was first coined by Russell in 1911, its main proponent. However, logical atomism has older roots. Russell referred to his atomistic doctrine as contrary to the tier "of the people who more or less follow Hegel". The first principle of logical atomism is that the World contains "facts". The facts are complex structures consisting of objects ("particulars"). A fact may be that an object has a property or that it stands in some relation to other objects. In addition, there are judgments ("beliefs"), which are in a relationship to the facts, and by this relationship either true or false. According to this theory, even ordinary objects of daily life "are apparently complex entities". According to Russell, words like "this" and "that" are used to denote particulars. In contrast, ordinary names such as "Socrates" actually are definitive descriptions. In the analysis of "Plato talks with his pupils", "Plato" needs to be replaced with something like "the man who was the teacher of Aristotle". Russell's theory of descriptions was crucial to logical atomism, as Russell believed that language mirrored reality.

## Logical holism
In Philosophy, logical holism is the belief that the world operates in such a way that no part can be known without the whole being known first. This belief is related to monism, and is associated with the absolute idealism which was dominant in Britain at the time. Logical atomism can be understood as a developed alternative to logical holism, or the "monistic logic" of the absolute idealists.

## Noumenon
Noumenon is a posited object or event that exists independently of human sense or perception. Noumenon is contrasted with phenomenon, which refers to anything that can be apprehended by (or is an object of) the senses.

## Objectivism
Objectivism is a philosophical system created by Ayn Rand that declares real knowledge to be metaphysically objective. *Moral objectivism* or *moral realism*, the meta-ethical position that ethical sentences express factual propositions about robust or mind-independent features of the world, and that some such propositions are true. *Anti-psychologism* or *logical objectivism* is the conviction that the rules of logic are mind-independent.

## Phenomenon
The term "phenomenon" refers to anything that can be apprehended by (or is an object of) the senses. Phenomenon is contrasted with noumenon, which is a posited object or event that exists independently of human sense or perception.

## Psychologism
Psychologism is a family of philosophical positions, according to which certain psychological notions play a central role in grounding or explaining certain non-psychological notions.

The view or doctrine that a theory of psychology or ideas forms the basis of an account of metaphysics, epistemology, or meaning. (spec.) The explanation or derivation of mathematical or logical laws in terms of psychological facts.

## Philosophical logic
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_logic

Philosophical logic refers to those areas of philosophy in which recognized methods of logic are used to advance the discussion of philosophical problems. Philosophical logic is the area of logic that studies the application of logical methods to philosophical problems, often in the form of extended logical systems like modal logic. Among these are the study of argument and meaning, but also of identity, existence, predication, necessity and truth. Philosophical logic also addresses extensions and alternatives to traditional classical logics, known as non-classical logics.

Philosophical logic forms one field of inquiry within the philosophy of logic. An important issue for philosophical logic is the question of how to classify the great variety of non-classical logical systems, many of which have recent origin.

One form of classification is to distinguish between *extended logics* (alethic modal logic, deontic modal logic, temporal logic, epistemic logic, etc.) and *deviant logics* (intuitionistic logic, free logic, many-valued logic, paraconsistent logics, etc.).


## Philosophy of language
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language

In analytic philosophy, philosophy of language investigates the nature of language and the relations between language, language users, and the world.

Investigations may include inquiry into the nature of meaning, intentionality, reference, the constitution of sentences, concepts, learning, and thought.

Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell were pivotal figures in analytic philosophy's "linguistic turn". They were followed by Ludwig Wittgenstein (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus), the Vienna Circle, logical positivists, and Willard Van Orman Quine.

In continental philosophy, language is not studied as a separate discipline. Rather, it is an inextricable part of many other areas of thought, such as phenomenology, structural semiotics, language of mathematics, hermeneutics, existentialism, deconstruction and critical theory.

## State of affairs
A state of affairs (or situation) is a way the actual world must be in order to make some given proposition about the actual world's truth; in other words, a state of affairs is a truth-maker, whereas a proposition is a truth-bearer. Whereas states of affairs either obtain or fail-to-obtain, propositions are either true or false.

## Theory of descriptions
The Theory of Descriptions (aka Russell's Theory of Descriptions, RTD) is the Bertrand Russell's most significant contribution to the philosophy of language.

In short, Russell argued that the syntactic form of descriptions (phrases that took the form of "The aardvark" and "An aardvark") is misleading, as it does not correlate their logical and/or semantic architecture. While descriptions may seem fairly uncontroversial phrases, Russell argued that providing a satisfactory analysis of the linguistic and logical properties of a description is vital to clarity in important philosophical debates, particularly in semantic arguments, epistemology and metaphysical elements.

## Theology
- τέλος ‹telos› end, aim, goal
- Relating to the doctrine of design and purpose in the material world.
- Relating to or involving the explanation of phenomena in terms of the purpose they serve rather than of the cause by which they arise.

Teleology or *finality* is a reason or an explanation for something which serves as a function of its end, its purpose, or its goal, as opposed to something which serves as a function of its cause. A purpose that is imposed by human use, such as the purpose of a fork to hold food, is called *extrinsic*.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology

## Telos
"Telos" is a term used by Aristotle to refer to the final cause of a natural organ or entity, or of a work of human art. "Telos" is the root of the modern term "teleology", the study of purposiveness or of objects with a view to their aims, purposes, or intentions. Teleology, is central in Aristotle's work on plant and animal biology, and human ethics, through his theory of the 4 causes. Aristotle's notion that everything has a telos also gave rise to epistemology.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos

## Type-token distinction
The [type-token distinction](./pages/type-token-distinction.md) is the difference between naming a class (type) of objects and naming the individual instances (tokens) of that class. The type-token distinction separates types (abstract descriptive concepts) from tokens (objects that instantiate concepts).

## Universal
In metaphysics, a universal is what particular things have in common, namely characteristics or qualities. Universals are repeatable or recurrent entities that can be instantiated or exemplified by many particular things.
