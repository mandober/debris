# Formal semantics of natural languages

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_(natural_language)

*Formal semantics* is the study of grammatical meaning in natural languages using formal tools from logic, mathematics and theoretical computer science.

Formal semantics provides accounts of what linguistic expressions mean and how their meanings are composed from the meanings of their parts.

The enterprise of formal semantics can be thought of as that of reverse-engineering the semantic components of natural language grammars.

## Overview

Formal semantics studies the *denotations* of natural language expressions.

High-level concerns of formal semantics include:
- compositionality
- reference
- the nature of meaning

Key topic of formal semantics include:
- scope
- modality
- binding
- tense
- aspect

Semantics is distinct from *pragmatics*, which is about *communicative intent*, encompassing aspects of meaning which arise from interaction.


Formal semantics is an interdisciplinary field, often viewed as a subfield of both linguistics and philosophy, while also incorporating work from computer science, mathematical logic, and cognitive psychology.

Within *philosophy*, formal semanticists typically adopt a *Platonistic ontology* and an *externalist view of meaning*.

Within *linguistics*, it is more common to view formal semantics as part of the study of *linguistic cognition*.

As a result, philosophers place more emphasis on conceptual issues, while linguists are more likely to focus on the syntax-semantics interface and cross-linguistic variation.

## Central concepts

Central concepts of formal semantics are truth conditions and compositionality.

### Truth conditions

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_conditions

>The fundamental question of formal semantics is what you know when you know how to interpret expressions of a language.

A common assumption is that knowing the meaning of a sentence requires knowing its truth conditions, i.e. knowing what the world would have to be like (possible worlds semantics) for the sentence to be true.

For instance, to know the meaning of the English sentence "Nancy smokes" one has to know that it is true when the person Nancy performs the action of smoking.

However, many current approaches to formal semantics posit that there is more to meaning than truth-conditions.

In the formal semantic framework of inquisitive semantics, knowing the meaning of a sentence also requires knowing what issues (i.e. questions) it raises. For instance "Nancy smokes, but does she drink?" conveys the same truth-conditional information as the previous example but also raises an issue of whether Nancy drinks.

Other approaches generalize the concept of truth conditionality or treat it as epiphenomenal. For instance in dynamic semantics, knowing the meaning of a sentence amounts to knowing how it updates a context. Pietroski treats meanings as instructions to build concepts.



### Compositionality
