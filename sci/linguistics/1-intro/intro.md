# Intro to linguistics

Linguistics analyses languages into constituent its
  parts           studied by
- sentences       (syntax)     ↓ composed by
- ↑ phrases       (syntax)
- ↑ words         (morphology)
- ↑ morphemes     (morphology)
- ↑ phonemes      (phonology)
- ↑ features      (phonology)
- ↑ pronunciation (phonetics)  ↑ comprise

There is also
- semantics
- pragmatics
- philosophy of language
- psichology of language
- sociology of language
- language technology
- language aquisition

There is abour 6000 live languages, but 90% of population speaks only 10%.

Natural language are difficult to analyse due to their famous ambiguity. The sentence "I made her duck" has about 15 meanings.

## Core properties of languages

Core properties of languages:
- communicativity
- semanticity
- cultural transmition
- displacement
- productivity

### Communicativity

**Communicativity** is about communication, and it implies that there must be a way to *produce* and *perceive* utterances. The 3 ways in which language are produced and perceived, called *modalities*, are:
- auditory-vocal (talking - hearing)
- visual-gestural (signing - seeing)
- visual-wrriten (writing - reading)

Writing is only ~5000 years old.

### Semanticity

**Semanticity** means that all linguistic forms have a meaning or function in a language. Semanticity comes in pairs of `(form, meaning)` called a **sign**. *Semiotics* studies how form is connected with a meaning; e.g. How does a sound produce a certain image in the mind?

3 kind of **signs**:
- *icon*: form resambles the meaning (e.g. crossed out image of a cigarette)
- *index*: form resambles a result of the meaning (e.g. "skull n' bones")
- *symbol*: form arbitrarily associated with meaning, by convention (e.g. "cat")

Majority of form-meaning associations are symbolic. This property is known as the *arbitrariness of the sign* (de Saussure). Words are symbols; every language has different forms (symbols) for the same meaning. *Onomatopoeia* is when a word sounds like its meaning (e.g. "buzz", "achoo").

### Cultural transmition

A native language is learned by aquisition, by hearing people talk. As opposed to, e.g. bird songs, which are realized by generic transmittion (although some birds do learn songs by listening to other birds).

### Displacement

We can use language to talk about things that are not immediately perceptable. As opposed to moneky alarm calls tht monkeys use to warn others about the nearby predator. Vervet moneky alarm calls are arbitrary and culturally transmitted, but have no notion of displacement - emitted only when a monkey sees an immediate predator.

### Productivity

Productivity means that linguistic units can be recombined to express novel meanings. e.g. good+ness vs pine-scented-ness, although probably unheard of, the meanning of the latter is still clear. Productivity implies we can express infinitily many ideas. Majority of sentences have never been spoken before, yet their meaing is clear.

Typically, a language has 50 phonemes, and 50,000 words, but ∞ sentences.

## Language

>Language is a learned system of signs that enables us to communicate an unlimited number of meanings about any topic.

Language is a *learned* (cultural transmition) *system of signs* (semanticity) that enables us to *communicate* (communicativity) an *unlimited number of meanings* (productivity) about *any topic* (displacement).

## Grammar

- descriptive grammar (is)
- prescriptive grammar (ought to be)

Orthography
- e.g. "thou" was used to address a single person (2nd p sn), "you" to address more than one (2nd p pl).
- "less" vs "fewer"

Linguistics does not regulate the grammar of a language, it studies the encountered situation, i.e. it is a descriptive science - a scientific description of language. So, "ungrammatical" just means something that no one would ever say. Grammar is mostly intuitive - *mental grammar*.
