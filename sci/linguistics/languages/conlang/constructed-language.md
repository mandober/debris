# Constructed language

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language

A **constructed language** (sometimes called a *conlang*) is a language whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary, instead of having developed naturally, are consciously devised for some purpose, which may include being devised for a work of fiction.

A constructed language may also be referred to as an *artificial*, *planned* or *invented* language, or in some cases a *fictional* language.

*Planned languages* (or engineered languages/engelangs) are languages that have been purposefully designed; they are the result of deliberate, controlling intervention and are thus of a form of *language planning*.

There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human communication (see international auxiliary language and code); to give fiction or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism; for experimentation in the fields of linguistics, cognitive science, and machine learning; for artistic creation; and for language games. Some people make constructed languages simply because they enjoy doing it.

The *expression planned language* is sometimes used to indicate international auxiliary languages and other languages designed for actual use in human communication. Some prefer it to the adjective artificial, as this term may be perceived as pejorative.

Outside Esperanto culture, the term *language planning* means the prescriptions given to a natural language to standardize it; in this regard, even a "natural language" may be artificial in some respects, meaning some of its words have been crafted by conscious decision.

*Prescriptive grammars*, which date to ancient times for classical languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, are rule-based codifications of natural languages, such codifications being a middle ground between naïve natural selection and development of language and its explicit construction. The term *glossopoeia* is also used to mean language construction, particularly construction of artistic languages.

Conlang speakers are rare. For example, the Hungarian census of 2011 found 8397 speakers of *Esperanto*, and the census of 2001 found 10 of *Romanid*, two each of *Interlingua* and *Ido* and one each of *Idiom Neutral* and *Mundolinco*. The Russian census of 2010 found that there were in Russia about 992 speakers of Esperanto (on place 120) and nine of the *Esperantido Ido*.

## Planned, constructed, artificial

The terms "planned", "constructed", and "artificial" are used differently in some traditions. For example, few speakers of *Interlingua* consider their language artificial, since they assert that it has no invented content: Interlingua's vocabulary is taken from a small set of natural languages, and its grammar is based closely on these source languages, even including some degree of irregularity; its proponents prefer to describe its vocabulary and grammar as standardized rather than artificial or constructed. Similarly, Latino sine flexione (LsF) is a simplification of Latin from which the inflections have been removed. As with Interlingua, some prefer to describe its development as "planning" rather than "constructing". Some speakers of Esperanto and Esperantidoj also avoid the term "artificial language" because they deny that there is anything "unnatural" about the use of their language in human communication.

By contrast, some philosophers have argued that all human languages are conventional or artificial. François Rabelais's fictional giant Pantagruel, for instance, said: "It is a misuse of terms to say that we have natural language; languages exist through arbitrary institutions and the conventions of peoples. Voices, as the dialecticians say, don't signify naturally, but capriciously."[9]

Furthermore, fictional or experimental languages can be considered naturalistic if they model real world languages. For example, if a naturalistic conlang is derived a posteriori from another language (real or constructed), it should imitate natural processes of phonological, lexical, and grammatical change. In contrast with languages such as Interlingua, naturalistic fictional languages are not usually intended for easy learning or communication. Thus, naturalistic fictional languages tend to be more difficult and complex. While Interlingua has simpler grammar, syntax, and orthography than its source languages (though more complex and irregular than Esperanto or its descendants), naturalistic fictional languages typically mimic behaviors of natural languages like irregular verbs and nouns, and complicated phonological processes.

## Overview

In terms of purpose, most constructed languages can broadly be divided into:
* **Engineered languages**, *engelangs* /ˈɛnd͡ʒlæŋz/), further subdivided into
  - logical languages, *loglangs*
  - philosophical languages
  - experimental languages
* **Auxiliary languages**, *auxlangs* or IALs (for International Auxiliary Languages), devised for interlinguistic or international communication
* **Artistic languages**, *artlangs*, devised to create aesthetic pleasure or humorous effect; secret languages and mystical languages are also usually classified as artlangs.
