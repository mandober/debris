**Lojban** [ˈloʒban] is a logical, constructed, syntactically unambiguous human language created by the Logical Language Group. It succeeds the Loglan project.

The Logical Language Group (LLG) began developing Lojban in 1987. The LLG sought to realize Loglan's purposes, and further improve the language by making it more usable and freely available (as indicated by its official full English title, Lojban: A Realization of Loglan). After a long initial period of debating and testing, the baseline was completed in 1997, and published as "The Complete Lojban Language". In an interview in 2010 with The New York Times, Arika Okrent, the author of "In the Land of Invented Languages", stated: "The constructed language with the most complete grammar is probably Lojban-a language created to reflect the *principles of logic*".

Lojban is proposed as a speakable language for communication between people of different language backgrounds, as a potential means of machine translation, and as a tool to explore the intersection between human language and software.

## Etymology

The name "Lojban" is a compound formed from *loj* and *ban*, which are short forms of *logji* (logic) and *bangu* (language).

## History

Lojban's predecessor, `Loglan`, a language invented by James Cooke Brown in 1955 and later developed by The Loglan Institute, was originally conceived as a means to examine the influence of language on the speaker's thought - an assumption known as *the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis*.

As Brown started to claim his copyright on the language's components, bans were put on the language community's activities to stop changes to aspects of the language. In order to circumvent such control, a group of Loglan users decided to initiate a separate project, departing from the lexical basis of Loglan and reinventing the whole vocabulary, which led to the current lexicon of `Lojban`. To this effect, they established The Logical Language Group in 1987, based in Washington, D.C. They also won a trial over whether they could call their version of the language Loglan.

The phonetic form of `Lojban gismu` (root words) *was created algorithmically* by searching for sound patterns in words with similar meanings in world languages and by multiplying those sound patterns by the number of speakers of those languages.

The list of source languages used for the algorithm was limited to the 6 most widely spoken languages as of 1987: Mandarin, English, Hindi, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic.

This resulted in root words being in their phonetic form a relatively equal mixture of English and Mandarin, with lesser influences from the other four.

Lojban also utilizes a set of evidential indicators adapted from the constructed language `Láadan`.

Following the publication of The Complete Lojban Language, it was expected that the documented lexicon would be baselined, and the combination of lexicon and reference grammar would be frozen for a minimum of 5 years while language usage grew. As scheduled, this period, which has officially been called the freeze, expired in 2002. The speakers of Lojban are now free to construct new words and idioms, and decide where the language is heading.
