# International Phonetic Alphabet

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is an alphabetic system of *phonetic notation* based primarily on the Latin script.

IPA was established by the International Phonetic Association in the late 19th century to standardize the notation of speech sounds (phones).

The IPA is used by lexicographers, foreign language students and teachers, linguists, speech-language pathologists, singers, actors, constructed language creators, and translators.

A *pulmonic consonant* is a consonant produced by air pressure from the lungs, as opposed to ejective, implosive and click consonants.
