# Homogeneity and heterogeneity


(-geneity)     genos            γένος
homogeneity    homogeneous      ὁμογενής
heterogeneity  heterogeneous    ἑτερογενής


from
    ὁμός [homos] same
and
    ἕτερος [heteros] other, another, different
followed by
    γένος [genos] kind
(and, in English, the adjectival suffix `-ous`)

homo- gen  -ous
homo- gene -ous

The incorrect spelling, `homogenous`, has almost become the accepted alternative spelling due to the number of (ab)uses.
