# Semiotics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics

*Semiotics* is the study of sign processes (semiosis), which are any activity, conduct, or process that involves signs.

A *sign* is defined as anything that communicates a meaning that is not the sign itself to the sign's interpreter.

The *meaning* can be *intentional* such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or *unintentional*, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition.

Signs can communicate through any of the senses: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, gustatory.

The semiotics explores the study of signs and symbols as a significant part of communications, but unlike linguistics, semiotics also studies non-linguistic sign systems.

*Semiotics* includes the study of
- signs and sign processes
- signification
- symbolism
- indication
- designation
- likeness
- analogy
- allegory
- metonymy
- metaphor
- communication

Semiotics is frequently seen as having important anthropological and sociological dimensions; for example, the Italian semiotician and novelist Umberto Eco proposed that every cultural phenomenon may be studied as communication.

Some semioticians focus on the logical dimensions of the science, however. They examine areas belonging also to the life sciences - such as how organisms make predictions about, and adapt to, their semiotic niche in the world (semiosis).

In general, semiotic theories take signs or sign systems as their object of study: the communication of information in living organisms is covered in *biosemiotics*, including *zoosemiotics* and *phytosemiotics*.

Semiotics is not to be confused with the Saussurean tradition called *semiology*, which is a subset of semiotics.
