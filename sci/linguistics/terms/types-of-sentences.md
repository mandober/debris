# Types of sentences

Liguistics classifies sentences in two ways: *functionally* (based on their function) and *structurally* (based on their structure).

## Types of sentence based on function

Functionally, there are 4 types of sentences:
- declarative
- interrogative
- exclamatory
- imperative


`.` A *declarative sentence* is a sentence that makes a statement, provides an explanation, conveys facts. Declarative sentences are among the most common sentences in the English language. They end with a period. 
Examples:
- It is raining.
- The streets are wet.
- If it's raining, the streets are wet and slippery.
- If black cats bring bad luck, then tough luck.
- Slippery when wet.
- If it rains it pours.
- If you tolerate this then your childret will be next.
- You can be a part of solution or problem.
- We can either go to the races or to the opera.

`?` An *interrogative sentence* asks a question. A hallmark of interrogative sentences is that they usually begin with pronouns or auxiliary verbs, but in colloquial speech, they may also start with the subject. They end with a question mark.
- Where am I?
- 

`!` An *exclamatory sentence* ends with an exclamation mark or even with a pair of exclamation and question mark (?! or !?). These sentences communicate heightened emotion, excitement, extreme dislike and are often used as greetings, warnings or rallying cries. They are declarations like declarative sentences but with much stronger emotions. That's why they end in the exclamation mark.

Examples:
- Hey!
- I'll be back.
- Danger! Danger! High voltage!
- This is Spartaaaa!
- Eureka!
- Hic sunt dracones
- I can't believe she ran that fast!


`!` An *imperative sentence* ends with an exclamation mark. Whenever a demand is expressed, it's an imperative sentence. It could also be instructions, requests, a wish or demands. Basically anything you want to make happen can be expressed in what we call, imperative sentence. Notice how imperative sentences above are expressing something to happen, maybe strongly or mildly followed by an exclamation mark or a period respectively. Remember this while forming imperative sentences. Depending upon the sentence's mood, the sentence is followed by an exclamation mark or a period. Very strong emotions are of course followed by an exclamation mark.

- Noli turbare circulos meos!
- Don't you stray!
- Morituri te salutant!
- Favete linguis!
- Ad metalla!

Important note: Do not confuse imperative sentences with exclamatory sentences. One clear cut difference is that there's always a command in the imperative sentence whereas there never a command in the exclamatory sentence. Exclamatory sentences are strong declarations. Both sentences have exclamatory marks at the end, but they are different.

## Types of sentence based on structure

- simple sentence
- complex sentence
- compound sentence

The other way to categorize sentences is to classify them based on the structure.

### Simple sentence

A *simple sentence* is the most basic type of sentence. This kind of sentence consists of just one *independent clause*, which means it communicates a complete thought and contains a subject and a verb. A simple sentence is the smallest possible grammatically correct sentence; anything less is known as a *sentence fragment*.

- How are you?
- She built a garden.
- We found some sea glass.

### Complex sentences

In contrast to a simple sentence, a complex sentence contains one *independent clause* and at least one *dependent clause*. While an independent clause can be its own sentence, a dependent clause can't. Dependent clauses rely on the independent clauses in their sentences to provide context. Dependent clauses appear after a *conjunction* or marker word or before a comma. *Marker words* are words like whenever, although, since, while, and before. These words illustrate relationships between clauses.

- Before you enter my house, take off your shoes.
- Matt plays six different instruments, yet never performs in public.


### Compound sentences

Compound sentences are sentences that contain two or more independent clauses. In a compound sentence, the clauses are generally separated by either a comma paired with a coordinating conjunction or a semicolon. In some cases, they can be separated by a colon. How can you tell if you have a compound sentence? Swap out your semicolon, colon, or coordinating conjunction for a period. If you now have two distinct, complete sentences, you've got a compound sentence.

- I was thirsty, so I drank water.
- She searched through her entire closet; she could not find her denim jacket.
