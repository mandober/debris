# Lammatization of Latin verbs in a dictionary

In a dictionary, Latin verbs are listed with 4 "principal parts" (or fewer for deponent and defective verbs), which allow deduction of other conjugated forms:
1. indicative active present, first person singular
2. infinitive active present
3. indicative active perfect, first person singular
4. either supine or perfect passive participle (same stem)

The verb *ignoro, ignorare, ignoravi, ignoratus* is a first conjunction verb meaning *to ignore*.

## Latin script

**Latin script** or **Roman script** is a set of graphic signs/symbols based on the letters of the *classical Latin alphabet*. It was derived from a form of the Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet used by the Etruscans.
Several Latin-script alphabets exist, which differ in graphemes, collation and phonetic values from the classical Latin alphabet. The Latin script is the basis of the International Phonetic Alphabet and the 26 most widespread letters are the letters contained in the ISO basic Latin alphabet. Latin script is the basis for the largest number of alphabets of any writing system and is the most widely adopted writing system in the world (commonly used by about 70 percent of the world's population). Latin script is used as the standard method of writing in most Western, Central, as well as in some Eastern European languages, as well as in many languages in other parts of the world.
