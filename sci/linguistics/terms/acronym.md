# Acronym

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym

An **acronym** is a word formed from the initial components of a name or phrase.

Acronyms are usually formed from the initial letters of words, but sometimes also from the initial syllables, e.g. "Benelux" as a shorthand collective name for Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg.

They can also be a mixture, as in radar (RAdio Detection And Ranging).

Acronyms may always be pronounced by spelling out the individual letters (HTML, CSS, TNT, ATM, the 3-letter agencies), but those that have obtained the word status are often pronounced as one (NASA, UNESCO), and some keep on being pronounced both ways (JPEG, IUPAC).

Abbreviations formed from a string of initials and usually pronounced as individual letters are sometimes more specifically called *initialisms* or *alphabetisms*, even though no one has ever heard of the latter; for example, "e.g." from Latin's "exempli gratia" ("here's an example for its sake y'all").
