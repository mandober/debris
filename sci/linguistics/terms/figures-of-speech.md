*Synecdoche*
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synecdoche
A synecdoche (from Greek συνεκδοχή, synekdochē, 'simultaneous understanding') is a figure of speech in which a term for a part of something refers to the whole of something or vice versa.
A synecdoche is a class of *metonymy*, often by means of either mentioning a part for the whole (pars pro toto) or conversely the whole for one of its parts (totum pro parte). 
Synecdoche is a rhetorical trope and a type of figurative speech similar to metonymy, a figure of speech that uses a term that denotes one thing to refer to a related thing.
Examples from common English expressions include "suits" (for "businessmen"),"America" (for "the United States of America").
Synecdoche is often used as a type of *personification* by attaching a human aspect to a nonhuman thing. It is used in reference to political relations, including "having a footing", to mean a country or organization is in a position to act, or "the wrong hands", to describe opposing groups, usually in the context of military power.
e.g. "New York won the game" meaning NY Yankees won.

*Metaphor*: changing a word from its literal meaning to one not properly applicable but analogous to it; assertion of identity - rather than likeness as with *simile*.

*Metonymy*: substitution of cause for effect, proper name for one of its qualities.

In rhetoric, *antonomasia* is a kind of metonymy in which an epithet or phrase takes the place of a proper name, such as "the little corporal" for Napoleon I. Conversely, antonomasia can also be using a proper name as an archetypal name, to express a generic idea.

*Hendiadys* is a figure of speech used for emphasis, "The substitution of a conjunction for a subordination". The basic idea is to use two words linked by the conjunction "and" instead of the one modifying the other. English names for hendiadys include two for one and figure of twins.


meronym-holonym
- `part-of` relationship, subset
- `α ⊆ β`
In linguistics, *meronymy* is a semantic relation between a *meronym* denoting a part and a *holonym* denoting a whole. In simpler terms, a meronym is in a `part-of` relationship with its holonym. For example, finger is a meronym of hand which is its holonym. Similarly, engine is a meronym of car which is its holonym.

hyponym-hypernym
- `type-of` relationship, membership
- `α ∈ τ`, `α : τ`
In linguistics, *hyponymy* (from Greek ὑπό, hupó, "under", and ὄνυμα, ónuma, "name") is a semantic relation between a *hyponym* denoting a subtype and a *hypernym* or *hyperonym* denoting a supertype. In other words, the semantic field of the hyponym is included within that of the hypernym. In simpler terms, a hyponym is in a `type-of` relationship with its hypernym.
