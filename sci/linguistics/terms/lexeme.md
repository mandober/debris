# Lexeme

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme

A lexeme is 
a unit of *lexical meaning* 
that underlies a set of words 
related through *inflection*.

A lexeme is 
a *basic abstract unit of meaning*, 
a unit of *morphological analysis* in linguistics 
that roughly corresponds 
to a set of forms 
taken by a single *root word*. 

Lexemes and root words often are but need not be identical.


For example, words "run", "runs", "ran" and "running" 
are forms of the same lexeme represented as ʀᴜɴ (given in small caps). 
Some are easily shown as inflections of the lexeme ʀᴜɴ:   
run∙∅ (null suffix) and run∙s, while run∙n∙ing is a more complex example that conforms to the rule of doubling the consonant before the -ing suffix; the form "ran" is the most complex example in that it represents an irregular form of a verb in a past tense


*Lemma* (or citation form) is a form 
chosen by convention as the canonical form of a lexeme.

The lemma is the form used in dictionaries as an entry's headword. Other forms of a lexeme are often listed later in the entry if they are uncommon or irregularly inflected.
