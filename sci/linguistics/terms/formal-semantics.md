# Formal semantics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_semantics_(natural_language)

*Formal semantics* is the study of *grammatical meaning* in natural languages, using formal tools from logic and theoretical computer science.

It is an interdisciplinary field, sometimes regarded as a subfield of both linguistics and philosophy of language.

It provides accounts of what linguistic expressions mean and how their meanings are composed from the meanings of their parts.

The enterprise of formal semantics can be thought of as that of reverse engineering the semantic components of natural languages' grammars.
