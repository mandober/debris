# Grammatical category

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_category

In linguistics, a **grammatical category** or **grammatical feature** is a property of items within the grammar of a language.

Within each category there are two or more possible values (sometimes called grammemes), which are normally mutually exclusive.

Frequently encountered grammatical categories include:
- *Tense*, placement of a verb in a time frame, which can take values like
  - past
  - present
  - future

- *Number*, with values such as
  - singular, plural, dual, trial, paucal
  - countable, uncountable or partitive
  - inclusive, exclusive

- *Gender*, with values such as
  - masculine
  - feminine
  - neuter

- *Noun classes*, which are more general than just gender, and include additional classes like:
  - animated: humane, plants, animals, things,
  - immaterial: for concepts and verbal nouns/actions, also shapes

- *Locative relations*, which some languages would represent using grammatical cases or tenses, or by adding a possibly agglutinated lexeme such as a preposition, adjective, or particle.


Although the use of terms varies from author to author, a distinction should be made between *grammatical categories* and *lexical categories*.

**Lexical categories** (considered *syntactic categories*) largely correspond to the parts of speech of traditional grammar, and refer to nouns, adjectives, etc.

A phonological manifestation of a category value (for example, a word ending that marks "number" on a noun) is sometimes called an exponent.

**Grammatical relations** define relationships between phrases in parts of speech, depending on their position in the syntactic tree. Traditional relations include *subject*, *object*, and *indirect object*.
