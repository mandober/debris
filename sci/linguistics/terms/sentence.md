# Sentence

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)

In linguistics and grammar, a **sentence** is a *linguistic expression*.

English example: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".

In **traditional grammar**, it is typically defined as a *string of words that expresses a complete thought*, or as a *unit consisting of a subject and predicate*.

In **non-functional linguistics**, it is typically defined as a *maximal unit of syntactic structure* such as a *constituent* (a constituent is a word or a group of words that function as a single unit within a hierarchical structure).

In **functional linguistics**, it is defined as a unit of written texts delimited by *graphological features* such as upper-case letters and markers such as periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. This notion contrasts with a *curve*, which is delimited by phonologic features such as pitch and loudness and markers such as pauses; and with a *clause*, which is a sequence of words that represents some process going on throughout time.

A sentence can include words grouped meaningfully to express a statement, question, exclamation, command (request, suggestion).

## Typical associates

### Clauses

A sentence is typically associated with a *clause*, and a clause can be either a *clause simplex* or a *clause complex*.

A clause is a **clause simplex** if it represents a single process going on through time.

A clause is a **clause complex** if it represents a logical relation between two or more processes and is thus composed of two or more clause simplexes.

A clause (simplex) typically contains a *predication structure* with a subject noun phrase and a finite verb. Although the subject is usually a noun phrase, other kinds of phrases (such as gerund phrases) work as well, and some languages allow subjects to be omitted.

In the examples below, the subject of the outmost clause simplex is in italics and the subject of "boiling" is in square brackets. There is *clause embedding* in the second and third examples.

- _[Water]_ boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
- *It* is quite interesting *that [water] boils at 100 degrees Celsius*.
- *The fact that [water] boils at 100 degrees Celsius* is quite interesting.


There are two types of clauses:
- independent
- non-independent, interdependent

An **independent clause** realises a speech act such as a statement, a question, a command or an offer.

A **non-independent clause** does not realise any act. A non-independent clause (simplex or complex) is usually logically related to other non-independent clauses. Together, they usually constitute a single independent clause (complex). For that reason, non-independent clauses are also called *interdependent*.

For instance, the non-independent clause "because I have no friends" is related to the non-independent clause "I don't go out" in "I don't go out, because I have no friends".

The whole clause complex is independent because it realises a statement. What is stated is the *causal nexus* between "having no friend" and "not going out". When such a statement is acted out, the fact that the speaker doesn't go out is already established, therefore it cannot be stated. What is still open and under negotiation is the reason for that fact. The causal nexus is represented by the independent clause complex and not by the two interdependent clause simplexes.

See also *copula* for the consequences of the verb to be on the theory of sentence structure.

## Classification of sentences

### By structure

One traditional scheme for classifying English sentences is by **clause structure**: the number and types of clauses in the sentence with finite verbs.

- A *simple sentence* consists of a single independent clause with no dependent clauses.
- A *compound sentence* consists of multiple independent clauses with no dependent clauses. These clauses are joined together using conjunctions, punctuation, or both.
- A *complex sentence* consists of one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.
- A *compound-complex sentence* (or complex-compound sentence) consists of multiple independent clauses, at least one of which has at least one dependent clause.

### By function or speech act

Sentences can also be classified based on the speech act which they perform. English sentence types can be described as follows:
- A *declarative sentence* typically makes an assertion or statement: "You are my friend."
- An *interrogative sentence* typically raises a question: "Are you my friend?"
- An *imperative sentence* typically makes a command: "Be my friend!"
- An *exclamative sentence*, sometimes called an exclamatory sentence, typically expresses an exclamation: "What a good friend you are!"

The form (declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamative) and meaning (statement, question, command, or exclamation) of a sentence usually match, but not always.

For instance, the interrogative sentence "Can you pass me the salt?" is not intended to express a question but rather to express a command.

Likewise, the interrogative sentence "Can't you do anything right?" is not intended to express a question on the listener's ability, but rather to express a statement on the listener's lack of ability; (see *rhetorical question*).

### Major and minor sentences

A **major sentence** is a *regular sentence*; it has a subject and a predicate, e.g. "I have a ball". In this sentence, one can change the persons, e.g. "We have a ball". 

However, a minor sentence is an *irregular type* of sentence that does not contain a main clause, e.g. "Mary!", "Precisely so", "Next Tuesday evening after it gets dark".

Other examples of minor sentences are headings (e.g. the heading of this entry), stereotyped expressions ("Hello!"), emotional expressions ("Wow!"), proverbs, etc. These can also include nominal sentences like "The more, the merrier". These mostly omit a main verb for the sake of conciseness but may also do so in order to intensify the meaning around the nouns.

Sentences that comprise a single word are called *word sentences*, and the words themselves *sentence words*.
