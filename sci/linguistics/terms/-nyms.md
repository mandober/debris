## Acronym
A word formed from the initial components of a name or phrase.

## Meronym
In semantics, a meronym is a word that denotes a constituent part or a member of something. For example, apple is a meronym of apple tree; sometimes written as `apple < apple tree`. This part-to-whole relationship is called *meronymy* (adj. meronymous). Meronymy is not just a single relation but a bundle of different part-to-whole relationships.

The opposite of a meronym is a holonym - the name of the whole of which the meronym is a part. Apple tree is a holonym of apple (`apple tree > apple`). The whole-to-part relationship is called *holonymy* (adj. holonymous).

A term denoting a part of the whole, but used to refer to the whole. 
From Greek `meros` 'part' + `onuma` 'name'. 
For example, using "faces" to mean "people", as in "I see several familiar faces present". 
The opposite of a meronym is a *holonym* - the name of the whole of which the meronym is a part.
