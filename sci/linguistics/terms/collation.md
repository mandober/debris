# Collation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation

Collate
- combine information (texts, data), after collecting it.
- compare and analyse (two or more) sources of information.
- charset comparision rules, e.g. `compare 'a' 'Ã '` (LT, EQ, GT)
- verify the number and order of, e.g. the sheets of a doc.
- when printing `n` copies of a multi-page document, print all pages of each copy, as opposed to printing each page `n`-times. For example, a 3-page document that needs to be printed twice, may be printed in two ways: collated, as `1,2,3,1,2,3`, or non-collated, as `1,1,2,2,3,3`.
