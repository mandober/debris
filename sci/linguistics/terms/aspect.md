# Grammatical aspect

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_aspect

**Aspect** is a grammatical category that expresses how a verb (expressing action, event, state) extends over time.

**Perfective aspect** ("svršeni") is used in referring to an event conceived as *bounded and unitary, without reference to any flow of time during* ("I helped him"). The action of perfective verbs occured (once) in the past and it was done soon after. These are usually verbs that refer to actions that have a limited duration, that cannot go on indefinitely (e.g. to jump).

**Imperfective aspect** ("nesvršeni") is used for situations conceived as existing *continuously or repetitively as time flows* ("I was helping him", "I used to help people"). The action of imperfective verbs has occured in the past and for all we know it might still go on. These are usually verbs that refer to an even or action that may last indefinitely (e.g. to grow).

**Repeated aspect** ("učestali") is used for actions that are often perfective, but keep on repeating every so often; above it says that imperfective aspect is used for repetitive events, but this oneis for repeated perfective events. ("To keep on knocking").

**Dual aspect** ("dvovidski") is featured by some verbs that have a single form for both perfective and imperfective aspect; which of the two aspects is implied is context-dependent.

## Verbs in Serbian

*Glagolski vid*: trajanju glagolske radnje.

Glagolski aspekti (prema trajanju glagolske radnje - glagolski vid):
- svršeni
  - početno-svršeni
  - završno-svršeni
  - skroz-svršeni
- nesvršeni
  - trajne (permanent)
  - učestale (iterative verbs)
- dvovidski


1. Glagoli svršenog vida dele se na one
  - koji označavaju početak radnje: *početno-svršene* (poskočiti)
  - koji kazuju završetak radnje: *završno-svršene* (preskočiti)
  - koji označavaju celu radnju: *skroz-svršene* (skočiti)

English sometimes uses verbs with auxillary words (in, out, up, down, over, under, on, off, around, etc.) to express this or similar meanings (to turn: turn on, turn off, turn up, turn down, turn over, turn around, etc.).


2. Glagoli nesvršenog vida dele se na:
  - trajne
  - učestale (iterative verbs)

Ogromna većina glagola nesvršenog vida su trajni, a manji broj spada u grupu učestalih. Zato pažnju usmeravamo na učestale glagole. Glagoli ovog tipa dugo traju, ali im se radnja odvija iz više ponavljanja i prekida, na primer: lupkati, kuckati, skakutati, izvirivati se itd.




The Serbian language has an additional aspect form called *repeated/infrequent aspect*, which is used to refer to past actions that weren't completed at once (weren't carried out in go), but their extent spanned a period of time with the action being repeated every so often.

Verbs of this type of aspect are usually translated to English using the "keep on doing something" phrases (e.g. "He kept knocking at the door").

In Serbian, most verbs have a distinct form for all 3 aspects. That is, *a verb lemma* (that caries the meaning of all related verbs, of a verb family) is realized in all 3 aspects, so it often happens that one "root verb" is associated with 3 distinct "standalone" verbs, one for each form of aspect. Importantly, these are not word forms, i.e. inflections of a common stem, but completely separate verbs, albeit with a related meaning.

So most "meta-verbs" come in triplets, one verb for each form of aspect:
- imperfective (nesvršeni glagoli): 
  kucati (to knock)
- perfective (svršeni glagoli): 
  kucnuti (to be done with knocking, to knock once)
- repeated (učestali glagoli): 
  kuckati (to keep on knocking, to knock every so often)


- Verb aspect (glagolski vid): classification of verbs according to their duration (podela glagola prema trajanju glagolske radnje)
- svršeni, nesvršeni i učestali glagoli



## Aspect (cont.)

Aspect is a grammatical category that expresses how an action, event, state, denoted by a verb, extends over time. The two main types of aspect are perfective and imperfective aspects. A verb in the perfective aspect form (in Serbian "nesvršeni glagol") refers to a completed, wholesome, unitary action without referring to the flow of time during the execution of the action.

is used to refer to an event conceived as bounded and unitary, without reference to any flow of time during ("I helped him"). 

*Imperfective aspect* is used for situations conceived as existing continuously or repetitively as time flows ("I was helping him", "I used to help people").
