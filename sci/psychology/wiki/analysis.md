# Analysis

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis

*Analysis* is the process of breaking down a complex topic into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it.

The word comes from the Ancient Greek `ἀνάλυσις` (analysis, "a breaking-up" or "an untying;" from ana- "up, throughout" and lysis "a loosening").

The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), though analysis, as a formal concept, is a relatively recent development.

As a *formal concept*, the method has variously been ascribed to Alhazen, René Descartes (Discourse on the Method), and Galileo Galilei. It has also been ascribed to Isaac Newton, in the form of a practical method of physical discovery.

The converse of analysis is synthesis: putting the pieces back together again in a new or different whole.
