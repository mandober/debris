# Cognition

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition

**Cognition**, albeit lacking a strict definition, is a mental process of acquiring knowledge and forming comprehensions through thinking and experience.

Cognition encompasses all aspects of intellectual functions and processes such as: perception, attention, thought, imagination, intelligence; formation of knowledge, memory and working memory, judgment and evaluation, reasoning and computation, problem solving and decision making, comprehension and (production of) language.

>Cognitive processes use existing knowledge to discover new information.

Cognitive processes are analyzed from different perspectives within different contexts, notably in the fields of linguistics, musicology, anesthesia, neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology, education, philosophy, anthropology, biology, systemics, logic, and computer science.

These and other approaches to the analysis of cognition (such as embodied cognition) are synthesized in the developing field of *cognitive science*, a progressively autonomous academic discipline.
