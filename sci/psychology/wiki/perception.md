# Perception

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception

**Perception** involves physical stimulations (visual, chemical, auditory, tactile, etc.) of the sensory system, which are converted into electrical signals that are relayed through the nervous system into the brain which then identifies, interprets and organizes the signals, converting them into usable information about the current situation and environment in general.

Vision is mediated through light hitting the retina of the eye, smell is mediated through odor molecules, hearing through air pressure waves, touch through the tactile information, taste through the chemical anaysis of the food. Many of the senses involve quantum physics to properly explain.

Perception is not just a passive reception of external stimuli, but it is shaped by the recipient's knowledge, memory, expectations, attention. Also, perception involves internal states like self-appropriation, proprioception, hunger, arousal, tiredness, sleepiness, etc.

Sensory input is a process that transforms this low-level information to higher-level information (e.g. extracts shapes for object recognition). The process that follows connects a person's concepts and expectations (or knowledge), restorative and selective mechanisms (such as attention) that influence perception.

Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this processing happens outside *conscious awareness*.

Since the rise of *experimental psychology* in the 19th century, psychology's understanding of perception has progressed by combining a variety of techniques.

*Psychophysics* quantitatively describes the relationships between the physical qualities of the sensory input and perception. *Sensory neuroscience* studies the neural mechanisms underlying perception. Perceptual systems can also be studied *computationally*, in terms of the information they process. Perceptual issues in *philosophy* include the extent to which sensory qualities (sound, smell, color) exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perceiver.

Although people traditionally viewed the senses as passive receptors, the study of illusions and ambiguous images has demonstrated that the brain's perceptual systems actively and *pre-consciously* attempt to make sense of their input. There is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of hypothesis testing, analogous to science, or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary.

The perceptual systems of the brain enable individuals to see the world around them as stable, even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying. Human and other animal brains are structured in a modular way, with different areas processing different kinds of sensory information. Some of these modules take the form of sensory maps, mapping some aspect of the world across part of the brain's surface. These different modules are interconnected and influence each other. For instance, taste is strongly influenced by smell.
