In their most common sense, the terms *thought* and *thinking* refer to *conscious cognitive processes* that can happen independently of *sensory stimulation*.

Their most paradigmatic forms are *judging*, *reasoning*, *concept formation*, *problem solving*, and *deliberation*. But other mental processes, like considering an idea, memory or imagination, are also often included. These processes can happen internally independent of the sensory organs, unlike *perception*.

Understood in the widest sense, any mental event may constitute a form of thinking, including perception and *unconscious mental processes*.

In a slightly different sense, the term "thought" refers not to the mental processes themselves, but to *mental states*, or *systems of ideas*, brought about by these processes.

Various *theories of thinking* have been proposed, some of which aim to capture the characteristic features of thought.

**Platonists** hold that thinking consists in discerning and inspecting *Platonic forms* and their interrelations. It involves the ability to discriminate between the *pure forms* themselves and the mere imitations found in the sensory world.

**Aristotelianism** holds that to think about something is to instantiate in one's mind the *universal essence* of the object of thought. These *universals* are abstracted from sense experience and are not understood as existing in a changeless intelligible world, in contrast to Platonism.

**Conceptualism**, closely related to Aristotelianism, identifies thinking with mentally evoking *concepts* instead of instantiating essences.

**Inner speech theories** claim that thinking is a form of inner speech in which words are silently expressed in the thinker's mind. According to some accounts, this happens in a regular language, like English or French.

**The language of thought hypothesis**, on the other hand, holds that this happens in the medium of a unique *mental language* called **Mentalese**. Central to this idea is that linguistic representational systems are built up from atomic and compound representations and that this structure is also found in thought.

**Associationists** understand thinking as the succession of ideas or images. They are particularly interested in the laws of association that govern how the train of thought unfolds.

**Behaviorists**, by contrast, identify thinking with behavioral dispositions to engage in public intelligent behavior as a reaction to particular external stimuli.

**Computationalism** is the most recent of these theories. It sees thinking in analogy to how computers work in terms of the storage, transmission, and processing of information.


Various types of thinking are discussed in the academic literature.

**Judgment** is a mental operation in which a proposition is evoked and then either affirmed or denied.

**Reasoning** is a mental process of drawing conclusions from existing information (evidence, reasons, grounds).

Both judging and reasoning depend on the possession of the relevant concepts, which are acquired in the process of concept formation.

**Problem solving** is a type of thinking that aids reaching a predefined goal by overcoming obstacles.

**Deliberation** is a practical form of thought of plotting a possible course of action and assessing the reasons for and against the action. It leads to a decision by choosing the most favorable option.

**Episodic memory** and **imagination** present objects and situations in the mind, attempting to accurately reproduce what was previously experienced, in case of memory, or as an unconstrained arrangement, in case of imagination.

**Unconscious thought** is a type of thought that happens without the possibility of reflection. It is posited to explain how difficult problems are solved in cases where no conscious thought was involved.


Thought is discussed in various academic disciplines.

**Phenomenology** is interested in the experience of thinking. An important question in this field concerns the experiential character of thinking and to what extent this character can be explained in terms of sensory experience.

**Metaphysics** is, among other things, interested in the relation between mind and matter (mind-body problem). This concerns the question of how thinking can fit into the material world as described by the natural sciences.

**Cognitive psychology** aims to understand thought as a form of information processing. **Developmental psychology**, on the other hand, investigates the development of thought from birth to maturity and asks which factors this development depends on. **Psychoanalysis** emphasizes the role of the unconscious and how it affects a person's mental life.

Other fields concerned with thought include linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, biology, sociology.


Various concepts and theories are closely related to the topic of thought.

**Laws of thought** refer to the 3 fundamental laws of logic: the law of contradiction (LNC), the law of excluded middle (LEM), and the law of identity (LID).

**Counterfactual thinking** involves mental representations of non-actual situations and events in which the thinker tries to assess what would be the case if things had been different. *Thought experiments* often employ counterfactual thinking in order to illustrate theories or to test their plausibility.

**Critical thinking** is a form of thinking that is reasonable, reflective, and focused on determining what to believe or how to act.

**Positive thinking** involves focusing one's attention on the positive aspects of one's situation and is intimately related to *optimism*.
