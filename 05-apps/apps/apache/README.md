## Apache Software Foundation
Apache Software Foundation (ASF) provides support for the Apache Community of Open Source software projects, which provide software products for the public good. Apache projects are defined by collaborative consensus based processes, an open, pragmatic software license and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users.


## Apache Projects
The all-volunteer ASF develops, stewards, and incubates more than 350 Open Source projects and initiatives that cover a wide range of technologies.
