# Notepad2

`Notepad2` was a Windows app, created by Florian Balmer in 2004, as a more advanced version of the Windows built-in Notepad, infamous for being completely devoid of even the most fundamental features and elementary configuration options (that will change only years later, around the time of Windows 11).

Notepad2 was conceived as a replacement of the builtin Notepad, packing a reasonable amount of features and configuration options behind the, visually almost identical, still austere UI.

Despite its popularity, the Notepad2 project was abandoned by the author after the release of the version 4.2.25 in 2012. However, this wasn't the end of Notepad2 as the numerous mods (additional features) and forks (remakes and rebranding) soon started spawning, creating a whole new "Notepad2 scene".

## Metapath

The origanl Notepad2 app by Florian Balmer, as well as other forks that came later, was often accompanyied by another app called `metapath`
