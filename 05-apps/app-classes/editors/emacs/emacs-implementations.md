# Emacs implementations

- GNU Emacs
- XEmacs
- Spacemacs
- ...


Emacs was first written by Richard Stallman as a set of macros on top of another editor, called `teco`, in 1976. Since then, there have been many competing implementations of Emacs but today the prevalent ones are `XEmacs` and `GNU Emacs`.

Before, XEmacs was the more advanced and feature-rich editor, but this is no longer the case since Emacs 22, and to almost everyone, the term Emacs refers specifically to GNU Emacs. The schism between XEmacs and GNU Emacs was one of the first forks in the world of free software. Still today, XEmacs and GNU Emacs are developed in parallel.

From today's perspective the terminology around emacs may feel strangely different (yank vs cut, kill vs delete), but keep in mind that most of those terms had to be invented because they didn't exists at the time of emacs creation.

Emacs's source code git repository stretches back over 30 years and has more than 130,000 commits and nearly 600 committers.
