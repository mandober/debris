## About

This text develops a comprehensive theory of programming languages based on *type systems* and *structural operational semantics*. Language concepts are precisely defined by their static and dynamic semantics, presenting the essential tools both intuitively and rigorously while relying on only elementary mathematics. These tools are used to analyze and prove properties of languages and provide the framework for combining and comparing language features.

The broad range of concepts includes
- fundamental data types such as sums and products
- polymorphic and abstract types
- dynamic typing
- dynamic dispatch
- subtyping and refinement types
- symbols and dynamic classification
- parallelism and cost semantics
- concurrency
- distribution

The methods are directly applicable to language implementation, to the development of logics for reasoning about programs, and to the formal verification language properties such as type safety. 

This thoroughly revised second edition includes exercises at the end of nearly every chapter and a new chapter on *type refinements*.

The revision removes a number of typographical errors, corrects a few material errors (especially the formulation of the parallel abstract machine and of concurrency in Algol), and improves the writing throughout.

Some chapters have been deleted
- general pattern matching
- polarization
- restricted forms of polymorphism

Some chapters have been completely rewritten
- higher kinds

Some chapters have been substantially revised
- general and parametric inductive definitions
- concurrent and distributed Algol

Some chapters have been reorganized (to better distinguish *partial from total type theories*), and a new chapter has been added (on type refinements).

Titular attributions on several chapters have been removed, not to diminish credit, but to avoid confusion between the present and the original formulations of several topics.

A new system of (pronounceable!) language names has been introduced throughout. The exercises generally seek to expand on the ideas in the main text, and their solutions often involve significant technical ideas that merit study. Routine exercises of the kind one might include in a homework assignment are deliberately few.
