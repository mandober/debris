## Russell's blurb from the original dustcover

This book is intended for those who have no previous acquaintance with the topics of which it treats, and no more knowledge of mathematics than can be acquired at a primary school *or even at Eton*.

    Eton College is a public school in Eton, Berkshire, England. Eton has educated prime ministers, world leaders, Nobel laureates, Academy Award and BAFTA award-winning actors, and generations of the aristocracy, having been referred to as "the nurse of England's statesmen". Aristocratic or privileged backgrounds are no longer necessary requirements for entry.

    Eton is one of only three public schools to have retained the boys-only, boarding-only tradition, which means that its boys live at the school seven days a week. 

    Eton used to be renowned for its use of corporal punishment. Until 1964, offending boys could be summoned to receive a birching (a special wooden birching block was used for the purpose, with the boy being directed to fetch it and then kneel over it) on the bare posterior, in a semi-public ceremony. Between 1964 to 1970, the birching was replaced with caning, also applied to the bare buttocks, which was administered privately.


It sets forth in elementary form the logical definition of number, the analysis of the notion of order, the modern doctrine of the infinite, and the theory of descriptions and classes as symbolic fictions. The more controversial and uncertain aspects of the subject are subordinated to those which can by now be regarded as acquired scientific knowledge. 

These are explained without the use of symbols, but in such a way as to give readers a general understanding of the methods and purposes of mathematical logic, which, it is hoped, will be of interest not only to those who wish to proceed to a more serious study of the subject, but also to that wider circle who feel a desire to know the bearings of this important modern science.
