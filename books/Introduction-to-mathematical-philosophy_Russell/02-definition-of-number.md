# 2. Definition of Number

The question "*What is a number?*" is one which has been often asked, but has only been correctly answered in our own time. The answer was given by **Frege** in 1884, in his `Grundlagen der Arithmetik`.

In seeking a definition of number, the first thing to be clear about is what we may call the *grammar* of our inquiry. Many philosophers, when attempting to define number, are really setting to work to define plurality, which is quite a different thing.

*Number* is what is characteristic of numbers, as man is what is characteristic of men. A *plurality* is not an instance of number, but of some particular number.

>A trio of men, for example, is an instance of the number 3, and the number 3 is an instance of number; but the trio is not an instance of number.

This point may seem elementary and scarcely worth mentioning; yet it has proved too subtle for the philosophers, with few exceptions.

A particular number is not identical with any collection of terms having that number: the number 3 is not identical with the trio consisting of 3 men.

>The number 3 is something which all trios have in common, and which distinguishes them from other collections.

>A number is something that characterises certain collections, namely, those that have that number (those of that number).

Instead of speaking of a collection, we shall as a rule speak of a *class* or sometimes a *set*.

A *class* or collection may be defined in two ways that at first sight seem quite distinct: we may enumerate its members, or mention a defining property.

The definition which enumerates is called a **definition by extension**, and the one mentioning a defining property is called a **definition by intension**.

Of these two kinds of definition, the one by intension is logically more fundamental. This is shown by two considerations:
- extensional definition can always be reduced to an intensional one
- intensional one often cannot even theoretically be reduced to extensional


>A class is said to be **similar** to another when there is *one-one relation* of which the one class is the domain, while the other is the *converse domain*.

>The number of a class is the class of all those classes that are similar to it.

Thus the number of a couple will be the class of all couples. In fact, the class of all couples will be the number 2, according to our definition.


At the expense of a little oddity, this definition secures *definiteness* and *indubitableness*; and it is not difficult to prove that numbers so defined have all the properties that we expect numbers to have.

>We may now go on to define numbers in general as any one of the bundles into which similarity (isomorphism) collects classes.

>A number is a set of classes such that any two are similar to each other, and none outside the set are similar to any inside the set.

In other words,
>a number (in general) is any collection which is the number of one of its members.

or, more simply still: 
>A number is anything which is the number of some class.


Such a definition has a verbal appearance of being circular, but in fact it is not. We define "the number of a given class" without using the notion of number in general; therefore we may define number in general in terms of "the number of a given class" without committing any logical error.

We have now given a definition of numbers which will serve for *finite collections*. It remains to be seen how it will serve for infinite collections. But first we must decide what we mean by finite and infinite.
