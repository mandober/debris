# Glossary

Most sections and topics have their own glossary, so this one is the broadest common factor, defining only the most general terms.


## Trinitarianism
Trinitarianism is the correspondence between each of these: logic, type theory, category theory. Related terms: BHK interpretation, Curry-Howard isomorphism, propositions as types, proofs as programs.

## BHK interpretation
Brower-Hayting-Kolmogorov interpretation of intuitionistic logic. TL/DR: conjunction is a pair of proofs, disjunction is a disjoint tagged union (so it specifies which proof it holds), implication as a function that converts proofs.

## CHI
Curry-Howard isomorphism, aka propositions-as-types or proofs-as-programs. Crucial view for dependent type theories.

## Order in logic
- FOL: for all elements
- SOL: for all predicates (properties, relations)
- HOL: for all â€¦


## ZOL
Zeroth-order logic: vars range over shit.

## FOL
In FOL, "first-order" means that variables range only over the individuals that comprise the doamin of discorse (individuals make the first order or sort). In SOL, vars range over properties as well.
