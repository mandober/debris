# Abbreviations

Most sections and topics have their own list of abbreviations, so this list is just the broadest common factor, listing the most general shorthands.

## `∵` because
The symbol `∵` is used mostly in logic to mean "because", but it is also abused in general text so as to elide making errors by constantly writing "becasue".

## `∴` therefore
The symbol `∴` is used in logic to mean "therefore" (usually placed before the conclusion); it's sufficiently known to justify its abuse in the general setting.

## incl
including

## corr
correspondence; synonyms: *isomorphism*; correlation, similarity, resemblance, comparability, compatibility, agreement, consistency, *congruity*, conformity, uniformity, harmony, affinity, accordance, accord, concurrence.

## CHI
Curry-Howard isomorphism

## IL
Intuition∙istic logic

## FOL
