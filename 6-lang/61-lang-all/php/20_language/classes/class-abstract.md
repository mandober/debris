# Abstract class

https://www.brainbell.com/tutorials/php/abstract-interface-composition-aggregation.html

Abstract class
- cannot be instantiated
- may be extended by other classes
- may contain both normal and abstract methods
- must contain at least one abstract method
- abstract methods are signatures only, they have no body
- in the abstract class, methods declared abstract must either be defined (complete implementation with respect to the signature as it is in the abstract method) by subclasses (similarly to an interface)
- or, (re)declared as abstract
