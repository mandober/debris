# Language construct

**Language Construct** (LC) is just a keyword associated with a special role in the PHP language.

Language constructs are used with or without parenthesis: some LCs require parenthesis, while others  

don't. With some LC they make a semantic difference, with others they are inconsequential.


LCs may be used with or without parenthesis, although this choice can entail additional syntactic requirements with some language constructs.

A language construct used with parenthesis may resamble a function call, but one must clearly differentiate between the two because the former cannot be use where the latter can.

It's impossible to determine which is which just by observing the call site.

Language constructs include
- array(), array ()
- assert() PHP7+
- echo
- empty()
- include()
- isset()
- print
- require()
- unset()
