# PSR

PHP Standard Recommendation (PSR) - the PSRs are coding guidelines and recommendations.

The PHP Framework Interoperability Group (PHP FIG) aims to advance the PHP ecosystem by promoting standards that enable high interoperability between the conforming PHP *components*.

As is common in good software development, a PHP project, even one working to produce a single monumental application, should be constructed by composing smaller units of functionality. When these functional units are completely decoupled and independent from the sourranding code, they become **components** - a highly reusable pieces of functionality. However, lacking the common guidelines, the problem of incompatibility between components quickly emerges.

Standardization is the way to enable interoperability between different components, achieved by describing the rules, usually in the form of interfaces, that conforming components adhere to.

PHP FIG develops and publishes standards, informed by the emerging programming patterns found in the PHP projects in the wild, accompanied by the research and experimentation, to form PHP Standard Recommendations (PSRs).
