# Functional PHP

Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

In order to apply functional techniques effectively, a language must support:
- functions as first class citizens, pure functions
- function composition
- avoiding state mutation, immutability, referential transparency
- efficient recursion (TCO) (used instead of iterative loops)
- higher-level abstractions, ability to abstract over data shape
- algebraic types
- pattern matching
- tuples
- lazy evaluation (optional)
- monads for safe modelling of state changes
