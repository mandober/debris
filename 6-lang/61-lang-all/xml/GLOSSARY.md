## XML Tooling
XPath, XQuery, XPointer, XLink, XInclude, XProc

## XSLT
XSLT is a language that can transform XML into another format.

## XPath
XPath, i.e. XML Path Language, is used to navigate XML documents. XPath uses a syntax akin to that to refer to file system paths, to identify and navigate nodes in an XML document.

## XQuery
is a superset of XPath that also provides FLWOR syntax, which is SQL-like. XQuery stands for XML Query Language. It is a language to select subsets and substructures from a large set of XML files. XPath is used a lot in XQuery.

## XPointer
is an extension of XPath to address nodes more accurately within XML fragments or even subparts of nodes. XPointer includes XPath, but also provides a simpler position-based addressing scheme.

## XLink
XLink is a standard that defines relationships among multiple parts of XML.

## XInclude
XInclude is a standard that prescribes how to compose multiple pieces of XML into one document (using, for instance, XLink relationships).

## XProc
XProc is a standard, itself also expressed in XML, which describes the process step by step, also called *XML Pipelines*, of how XML documents should be processed to get desired result. Within XProc, use, e.g. XQuery, XSLT, XInclude languages to express what exactly needs to be done in each step.

## SoapUI
SoapUI is an open-source tool used for functional and non-functional testing, widely used in testing of web services.

## SOA
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of *software design* where services are provided over a network and different services can be combined to produce the final app. SOA integrates distributed, separately-maintained and separately-deployed software components.

## Web Service
A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and consumed independently. Services may be combined to comprise software components of a larger web app.

## CORBA
Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is a standard designed to facilitate the communication of systems that are deployed on different platforms, enabling collaboration between systems, independent of platforms and programming languages. CORBA uses OO model and distributed object paradigm.
