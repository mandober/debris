# Programing languages features

## Types
Static typing
Type inference
Partial types
implicit conversions:
- widening of integers
- coercing booleans
Algebraic types:
- Nullable types: Enums
- Sum types: Enums
- Product types: structs
- Pi types
- pattern matching
aggregate data
NULL value
multiple inheritance
traits
delegation
operator overloading
closures
lambda expressions
anonymous fn
(list) comprehensions
modules
Boxing and unboxing
type casting
destructuring
fn default params
fn named args
fn 'the rest' params
rest/spread operator
ranges (..)
variable variables
string handling (utf8, indexing, etc.)



## Safety
- array bounds checking
- valid reference/pointer checks

## Asynchronicity
- promises
- async/wait

## Concurrency
- green threading model
- 1:1 threading
- mutually-exclusive locks (MUTEX)
- RW locks
- data races?
- accessing (reading or wring to) shared storage

## Concepts
reflection 
Polymorphism
namespace
- syntactic sugar
Metaprogramming
overriding methods
overloading (methods)
run-time method binding
storage specifiers
- scope: block, function, file
- compile-time
- JIT
- runtime
- Generics
- Iterators
- Generators
- Anonymous methods
- First-class functions (as param, as retun)
function pointers 
- Traits
- Methods
- Auto-derived methods
- Exceptions
- Interfaces
- Inheritance
- constructors
- destructors
- classes
- Inherit from multiple classes
- Getter/setter separate accessibility
- Method group conversions (delegates)
- Co- and Contra-variance for delegates
- Static classes
- Delegate inference
