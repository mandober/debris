# Vue instancehttps://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.htmlEvery Vue application starts by creating a new Vue instance with `new Vue()`. We don't have to, but we may assign it to a JS var, e.g. `let app = new Vue()`, which will give us easier identifier to reference if we want to tinker with this instance in the JS console. There, in this case, it will be available as that var; otherwise, it is auto-created and exposed as e.g. `$wm0`.```js// create new vue instance and bind it to the `app` varlet app = new Vue();// or, as a convention, use `vm` (short for ViewModel) for var's name:let vm = new Vue();// If you don't bind it it is available as $vm0 or $vm1 or similar:new Vue();// Then, in the js console, the former ones are available by the bound name:app.property = ...vm.property = ...// the latter is available by auto generated name, patterm:$vm0.property = ...```## Configuration objectNew Vue instance expects a *configuration object* that will configure it. Thisobject is where a project's custom data and functions are defined.```let app = new Vue({  el: '#app'});```
