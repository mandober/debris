Lean is based on a version of dependent type theory known as the *Calculus of Constructions*, with a countable hierarchy of non-cumulative universes and inductive types.

Lean is a FPL that makes it easy to write correct and maintainable code. You can also use Lean as an interactive theorem prover. Lean programming primarily involves defining types and functions. This allows your focus to remain on the problem domain and manipulating its data, rather than the details of programming. You can prove properties of your functions using Lean itself.

Lean's features include
- Type inference
- First-class functions
- Powerful data types
- Pattern matching
- Type classes
- Extensible syntax
- Hygienic macros
- Dependent types
- Metaprogramming
- Multithreading
- Verification
