# Idris : About

Idris is a general purpose pure functional programming language with dependent types. In Idris, types are a first class language construct, meaning that they can be manipulated and computed like any other language construct. It encourages a type-driven style of development, in which programmers give types first and use interactive editing tools to derive programs. Introductory examples typically involve length-preserving operations on lists, or ordering invariants on sorting.

Realistically, though, programming is not so simple: programs interact with users, communicate over networks, manipulate state, deal with erroneous input, and so on. In this talk I will show how advanced type systems allow us to express such interactions precisely, and how they support verification of stateful systems as a result.

The talk will include several examples, leading to a verified implementation of a word game (Hangman). I will show how Type-driven Development allows programmers to specify the game rules in a direct and concise style, and how it leads to an implementation, guaranteed to correctly follow the rules by typechecking.
