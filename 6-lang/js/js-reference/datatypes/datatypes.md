# JS Data Types

JS has several primitive datatypes and a single compound datatype called object. The problem with the term "object" in JS begins here - it is a collective noun used to refer to a huge set of objects that are sufficiently similar to share a common ancestor, but each has a different specialization.

- object - the "umbrella" term for any kind of non-primitive entity or entities
- object - collective name for the entire class of compound types in JS
- object - any member of the object class: `typeof [] == "object"`
- object - the member called object: `typeof {} == "object"`
- object - common ancestor that all objects in the class share
- Object - function: `Æ’ Object() { [native code] }`


The confusion arises because the compound object is actually a whole set of objects, including one called "object" as well.

Primitive types:
- boolean
- number
- bigint
- string
- symbol
- undefined
- null

Compound type:
- object




# Standard objects by category
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects


## Value properties

These global properties return a simple value; they have no properties or methods.

```js
Infinity
NaN
undefined
null
```


## Properties (attributes and methods)



## Global functions
These functions are called globally and directly, rather than
on an object, and they return their results to the caller.
*There are 12 global functions:*

1.  eval()
2.  uneval()
3.  isFinite()
4.  isNaN()
5.  parseFloat()
6.  parseInt()
7.  decodeURI()
8.  decodeURIComponent()
9.  encodeURI()
10. encodeURIComponent()
11. escape()
12. unescape()
