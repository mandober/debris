# Primitive types

There are 6 primitive values in JS:
1. Boolean
2. Number
3. BigInt
4. String
5. Symbol
6. undefined
7. null


## Numbers

All numbers are impl as IEEE floating point *binary64* (in other languages known as `f64`, `Double`, `double`). Internally, there's no distinction between integers and floats, but there are builtin funcs used to distinguish them.
