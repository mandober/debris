# Agda :: Intro

The data declaration introduces a data type with its two ctors.

```hs agda
data Bool : Set where
  true  : Bool
  false : Bool

not : Bool -> Bool
not true = false
not false = true

equiv : Bool -> Bool -> Bool
equiv true  true  = true
equiv true  false = false
equiv false true  = false
equiv false false = true
```

This declaration states that `Bool` is a member of the type `Set`, which in turn is the type of sets or small types (terminology by Martin-Lof).

* Thus, `Bool` is a small type, but `Set` is a *large type*.
* A signature `Set : Set` would imply inconsistency, letting us prove anything.

* In general, Agda cannot infer types. However, we can always check whether a certain term has a certain type, provided it is in a *normal term*.
* Agda's typechecker uses *normalisation*, also called simplification, and without the *normality restriction* it would not terminate.
* Agda insists on *total functions*, therefore patterns in a function definition must be exhaustive.

* Agda supports infix and mixfix operators, and it is more permissive than Haskell about which characters can form an operator's name, and about the number and the position of arguments.

* In Agda, an identifier may consist of any sequence of characters except spaces and these characters: `@ . ( ) { } ; _`. This implies that almost all tokens (words) must be surrounded by spaces.

* The places of args in an infix operator are indicated with underscores. The proper operator name includes the underscores, except when it is used in the infix position.

```hs agda
-- decl of an binnary function (operator)
_||_ : Bool -> Bool -> Bool -- proper name in signatures (no type vars anyway)
true || true = true         -- "short" name when used infix
_||_ _  _    = false        -- proper name when used prefix

infixl 60 _||_              -- proper name when in fixity decl


-- decl of a ternary function (operator)
if_then_else_ : {C : Set} -> Bool -> C -> C -> C
if true  then x else y = x
if false then x else y = y
```

* *Implicit arguments* are stated in braces. Optionally, they may be bound by patterns in braces.

* The precedence and association of infix operators are the same as in Haskell, except that the precedence goes from 1 to 99.

* The wildcard (`_`) is used as the pattern the same way as in Haskell.

* Agda offers the use of decimal representation for natural numbers by enabling the pragma:

```hs agda
-- for using Nat in decimal notation (use 0 instead of zero, etc.)
{-# BUILTIN NATURAL Nat   #-}

-- for using + and * as ops on Naturals
{-# BUILTIN NATPLUS  _+_  #-}
{-# BUILTIN NATTIMES _*_  #-}
```


## Inductively defined types

In Haskell, data declarations that use type recursion are called recursive data type, but in constructive type theory, they are called **inductive types** or **inductively defined types**.

```agda
data Nat : Set where
  zero : Nat
  succ : Nat -> Nat

pred : Nat -> Nat
pred zero = zero
pred (succ n) = n

_+_ : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
zero + m = m
succ n + m = succ (n + m)

_*_ : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
zero * n = zero
succ n * m = n * m + m
```

## Canonical form

Given a first order data type, Agda distinguishes between canonical forms and non-canonical forms. A **canonical form** only contains the ctors, whereas **non-canonical form** can contain defined functions.

For example:
- canonical forms: `true`, `false`, `succ (succ zero)`
- non-canonical forms: `not true`, `zero * zero`, `succ (zero + zero)`

More precisely, Per Martin-Lof uses the notion of **lazy canonical forms**, which are forms that just need to begin with a constructor to be considered canonical. Under this view, the form `succ (zero + zero)` would indeed be a lazy canonical form, but not the "full" canonical form.

## Lambda Notation and Polymorphism

Lambda abstraction may be written in
- Curry-style, `\x -> e` (without a type label on the argument `x`)
- Church-style, `\(x : A) -> e` (with a type label)

* The Curry-style  identity function is: `\ x      -> x : A -> A`
* The Church-style identity function is: `\(x : A) -> x : A -> A`

The above typings are valid for any type `A`, so `\x -> x` is polymorphic, that
is, it has many types.


Haskell would infer the type `\x -> x :: a -> a` for a type variable `a`. However, **Agda doesn't have type variables**. Instead, we can express the fact that we have a family of identity functions (one for each small type) as:

```hs agda
id : (A : Set) -> A -> A
id = \(A : Set) -> \(x : A) -> x

-- we can also shift params on the LHS-RHS axes (ala Haskell)
id : (A : Set) -> A -> A
id A x = x

id : (A : Set) -> A -> A
id A = \x -> x
```

From this, it follows that `id A : A -> A` is the identity function on the small type `A`, that is, we can apply this "generic" identity function `id` to a type argument `A` to obtain the identity function from `A` to `A`; it's like when we write `idá´€` in math for the identity function on a set `A`.

## Dependent types

Here we see a first use of dependent types: the type `A -> A` depends on the variable `A : Set`, ranging over the small types.

Agda's notation for *dependent function types*:   
if `A` is a type 
and `B[x]` is a type 
which depends on (is indexed by) `(x : A)`, 
then `(x : A) -> B[x]` 
is the type of functions `f` 
mapping arguments `(x : A)` 
to values `f x : B[x]`.


```hs agda
K : (A B : Set) -> A -> B -> A
K _ _ a _ = a
--A B a b

S : (A B C : Set) -> (A -> B -> C) -> (A -> B) -> A -> C
S _ _ _ f g x = f x (g x)
--A B C
-- ignored but bound coz it's they are not implicit params (not in braces)


if_then_else_ : {C : Set} -> Bool -> C -> C -> C
if true  then x else y = x
if false then x else y = y

natrec : {C : Set} -> C -> (Nat -> C -> C) -> Nat -> C
natrec p h zero = p
natrec p h (succ n) = h n (natrec p h n)

plus : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
plus n m = natrec m (\x y -> succ y) n

mult : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
mult n m = natrec zero (\x y -> plus y m) n
```
