# Relations

In Agda, we can model a relation on a set `A` as a value `R : A -> A -> Set`.

Such an `R` takes in two elements of type `A` and returns a `Set`. Under the CHI, on which Agda is based, a `Set` can just as well be viewed as a formula. So, a binary relation, as modeled in Agda, is a function which takes two elements of `A` and returns a formula. But what formula is it? We should think of it as a formula that is provable iff the two elements indeed stand in the relation to one another.

```hs agda
-- ‚Üì _>_ a means that the > relation is well-founded below a.
-- That is, there are no infinite chains (a > a‚ÇÅ > ‚Ä¶) starting with a.
-- One can also say that > terminates from a.
data ‚Üì    {‚Ñì ‚Ñì'}
       -> {A : Set ‚Ñì}
       -> (_>_ : A  ->  A  ->  Set ‚Ñì')
        : A -> Set (‚Ñì ‚äî ‚Ñì')
  where
  pf‚Üì  :  ‚àÄ {x : A}
      -> (‚àÄ {y : A}  ->  x > y  ->  ‚Üì _>_ y)
      ->                            ‚Üì _>_ x


‚Üìùîπ : ‚àÄ {‚Ñì} {A : Set ‚Ñì} (_>_ : A  ->  A  ->  ùîπ)  -> A -> Set ‚Ñì
‚Üìùîπ     {‚Ñì} {A}          _>_                        x =
  ‚Üì    {‚Ñì} {lzero} (Œª (x y : A) -> (x > y) ‚â° true) x
```

This is more general than modeling a relation as a Boolean function of the type `A -> A -> ùîπ`. A concrete example is the function `_<_ : ‚Ñï -> ‚Ñï -> ùîπ`. We can model this as the relation `Œª (x y : ‚Ñï) -> x < y ‚â° true`.

This has type `‚Ñï ‚Üí ‚Ñï ‚Üí Set` because it takes in arg `x` and `y` of type `‚Ñï`, and returns `(x < y) ‚â° true`, which is a `Set`. Any function of type `A ‚Üí A ‚Üí ùîπ` can be turned into one of type `A ‚Üí A ‚Üí Set`, but the reverse is not possible in general, in Agda.

The file <termination.agda> uses a more general notion of relation as function of type `A ‚Üí A ‚Üí Set`, though there is also a helper definition for the more specific type of relation.

In the file <termination.agda>, the type `‚Üì` is used to express termination.

The type `‚Üì` takes in an explicit argument `_>_`, which is the binary relation about which the `‚Üì` type will express a termination property.

The type `‚Üì` also takes in an element of type `A`, which figures as the starting point from which the `‚Üì` type will express termination regarding the relation `_>_`.

As a convenience, in a common case of Boolean-valued functions, we have the function `‚Üìùîπ` which just wraps a Boolean-valued function as a relation, as we saw previously for `_>_` on the naturals.

For a simple but important example of termination, the type

```hs agda
‚àÄ (n : N) ‚Üí ‚ÜìB _>_ n
```

expresses the idea that for every natural number `n`, the GT relation is terminating. This is in fact true and proven in the file:

```hs agda
-- The proof that the (>) rel over the naturals is terminating
‚Üì-> : ‚àÄ (x : ‚Ñï) ‚Üí ‚Üìùîπ _>_ x
‚Üì-> x = pf‚Üì (h x)
  where h : ‚àÄ x ‚Üí ‚àÄ {y} ‚Üí x > y ‚â° tt ‚Üí ‚Üìùîπ _>_ y
        h 0 {0} () 
        h 0 {suc y} () 
        h (suc x) {y} p with <-drop {y} p 
        h (suc x) {y} p | inj‚ÇÅ u rewrite u = ‚Üì-> x
        h (suc x) {y} p | inj‚ÇÇ u = h x u
```
