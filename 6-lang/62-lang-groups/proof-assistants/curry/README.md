Curry is a declarative multi-paradigm programming language which combines in a seamless way features from functional programming (nested expressions, higher-order functions, strong typing, lazy evaluation) and logic programming (non-determinism, built-in search, free variables, partial data structures). Compared to the single programming paradigms, Curry provides additional features, like optimal evaluation for logic-oriented computations and flexible, non-deterministic pattern matching with user-defined functions.

* Compilers
Several implementations of Curry are available and/or under development. 

The most prominent representatives:
- `Portland Aachen Kiel Curry System (PAKCS)`
- `Kiel Curry System (KiCS2)`
- `MÃ¼nster Curry Compiler (MCC)`

* Package Manager
The `Curry Package Manager (CPM)` is a tool to distribute and install Curry libraries and applications and manage version dependencies between them. These libraries are organized in packages. There is a central index of all these packages which can easily be downloaded by CPM.

* CurryDoc
`CurryDoc` is a tool that generates the documentation for a Curry program in HTML (and optionally also LaTeX) format. The generated HTML pages contain information about all data types and operations exported by a module as well as links between the different entities.

* Curr(y)gle API Search
`Curr(y)gle` is a Curry API search engine which allows you to search the Curry libraries indexed by CPM. You can search by names of either operations, data types, and modules. It was designed following the example set by Haskell's search engine Hoogle.
