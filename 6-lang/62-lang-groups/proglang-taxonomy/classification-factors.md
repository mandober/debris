* Classification categories and factors
  - by generation
  - by family
  - by abstraction
  - by paradigm
  - by purpose
  - by type system
  - by domain

* by generation
  - 1st gen
  - 2nd gen
  - 3rd gen
  - 4th gen
  - 5th gen


* by abstraction
  - machine languages
  - assembly languages
  - high-level languages

* by paradigm
  - imperative
    - procedural
    - OO
  - declarative
    - functional
    - logic
    - reactive

* by purpose
  - programming languages
    - general programming language
    - scripting languages
  - query languages
  - modeling languages
  - presentation languages (HTML, CSS, markup)
  - description languages
  - formal logic languages (FOL, SOL, HOL, set theory)
  - academic (learning, investigation)
  - esoteric (pushing the limits, for shit n' giggles)

* by orientation
  - procedure-oriented
  - object-oriented
  - aspect-oriented

* by type system
  - statically-typed
    - dependently-typed
    - strongly-typed
    - weakly-typed
  - dynamically-typed

    - unforgiving (?)

* by domain
  * natural languages
    - artificial
  * domains
    - business application (DSL)
    - scientific application (data mining)
    - artificial intelligence (?)
    - systems programming (drivers, firmware, â€¦)
    - web platform (JS, Wasm, CCS, HTTP, HTML, XML, JSON)
    - glue languages (shell): bash, zsh, fish


* by key features
