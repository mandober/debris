* US-International keyboard layout
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-International
  However, some accented Latin letters less common in the major Western European languages, such as `š`, cannot be typed with the *US* layout. For users with US keyboards, access to many more diacritics is provided by the *US International* keyboard layout.




* AltGr (Alternative graphic) key
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr_key
  Some keyboards have an AltGr (Alternative graphic) key, which gives the 
  ability to modify some letters directly and turns others into dead keys 
  (depending on keyboard setting).
  In the absence of a default dead key, even a normal printing key can temporarily 
  be altered to function as a dead key by simultaneously holding down another 
  modifier key (typically AltGr).
  In Word, using the Control key with a key that usually resembles the diacritic
  (e.g. ^ for a circumflex) acts as a dead key.
