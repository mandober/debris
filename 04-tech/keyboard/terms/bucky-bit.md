# Bucky bit

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_bit

A **bucky bit** is a bit in a binary representation of a character that is set by pressing on a keyboard modifier key other than the SHIFT key.

Setting a bucky bit changes the output character.

A bucky bit allows the user to type a wider variety of characters and commands while maintaining a reasonable number of keys on a keyboard.

Some of the keys corresponding to bucky bits on modern keyboards are Alt, Control, Super key, Meta, Command key (âŒ˜), Option key.

In ASCII (which does not use the 8th bit), the bucky bit is usually **the 8th bit, aka the meta bit**.

However, in older character representations wider than 8 bits, more high bits could be used as bucky bits. In the modern X Window System, bucky bits are bits 18-23 of an event code.
