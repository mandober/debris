# Keyboard :: Input methods

The plain old keyboard as an input method allows you to input only a relatively small number of characters, that are mapped more-less 1-to-1 to the ASCII character set.

This is a comfortable way to type the small and capital letters of the Latin alphabet, along with a handful of punctuation symbols, and even two ways to enter numbers (top-row plus keypad).


This is relatively small compared to Unicode, which (as of version 14) has: ?


For example, the character encoding scheme
- ASCII comprises         128 code points in the range 0x00 to 0x7f
- Extended ASCII          256 code points in the range 0x00 to 0xff
- Unicode           1,114,112 code points in the range 0x00 to 0x10ffff


In X - the GUI system used in Linux - there are a number of different ways to input extra characters. Some are suitable for frequent use: use a "3rd Level Shift" (typically AltGr), dead keys, or input methods.

XCompose is an intermediate solution: each character is typed using a combination of a few custom keystrokes.

It's not fast enough to use in every word, but it's fairly easy to remember (or rediscover) for characters you might use once a day or once a fortnight, and much less annoying than having to search online that often.
