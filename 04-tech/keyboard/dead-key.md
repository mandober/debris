# Dead key

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key

A *dead key* does not generate a (complete) character by itself, but modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after.

Dead key is mechanical in origin, and "dead" means without movement (of the carriage on a classical typewriter).

A dead key is different from a typical modifier key, in that rather than being pressed and held while another key is struck, the dead key is pressed and released before striking the key to be modified.
