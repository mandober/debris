## Tenkeyless keyboard
Tenkeyless keyboard is a keyboard without the numpad (number pad), resulting in a keyboard around 80% of the full-sized keyboard.

Tenkeyless (10 key less) refers to the 10 number keys on the numpad (0-9), but actually the entire numpad section is absent.

Technically, any keyboard without a numpad is tenkeyless, but the term is usually reserved for a specific keyboard design where the *navigational keys* are located in 3 columns next to ENTER.

The Tenkeyless or TKL layout (or 80%) is a standard keyboard layout that removes the numpad.
