# Keyboard layout

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout

A **keyboard layout** is any specific physical arrangement of the keys, legends, or key-meaning associations of a computer keyboard.

**Physical layout** are the actual physical positions of keyboard keys.

**Visual layout** is the arrangement of legends (engravings, markings, labels) appearing on the keyboard keys.

**Functional layout** is the arrangement of the *key-meaning association* or *keyboard mapping*, determined in software, of all keyboard keys; it is this aspect that determines what happens when a particular key is pressed.

Modern keyboards send a *scancode* to the OS when a key is pressed or released, and this code only reports the key's row and column. The OS converts the scancode into a specific binary code using *scancode to character lookup table*, called the *keyboard mapping table*. This means that a physical keyboard may be dynamically mapped to any layout merely by configuring the interpretation of keystrokes.

Many OSs allow the user to change keyboard mapping, plus there is software to modify or extend keyboard functionality. Thus, the symbol shown on the physical *key-top* need not correspond to the interpretation (e.g. screen appearance) of that key.



* 101-key keyboard layout

Keyboards in the US and some other locations have 101 keys on them.
The scan codes for this layout are slightly different than the 102 key keyboard layout, and a key is missing. 

* 102-key keyboard layout

Keyboards in Europe and some other locations have 102 keys on them.
The scan codes for this layout are slightly different than the 101 key keyboard layout, and an extra key is present next to the left shift key.
