# Windows OS âˆ· GLOSSARY

## Windows Shell
Windows Shell is the main UI that provides users with means to run apps and manage the os. It presents the view into the local and remote file systems, as well as numerous virtual objects. Windows Shell organizes these objects into a hierarchical namespace and provides users and programs with the consistent interface.

## Virtual folders
Virtual folders are special directories that organize things logically rather then physically. They present logical views ("My PC", "My Docs"), or physical views ("Desktop") of indivudual folders ("Download"), or a set of related folders ("Recycle Bin"). Virtual folders are one type of virtual objects.

## Virtual objects
Virtual objects are a way to manage various tasks in a graphical way (as opposed from the command line). They present the user with a uniform view of both file system items (usually special folders) and tasks - logically organized views of Devices, Printers, Control Panel, Scheduled Tasks, etc.

## Iconography
Iconography is a set of visual images and symbols that help users understand and navigate around the OS and apps. Icons are used throughout the user interface as visual metaphors representing a concept, action, or status. Windows 11 uses 3 different type of icons: application icons, system icons and file type icons.
