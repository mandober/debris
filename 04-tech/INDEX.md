# Tech debrief

Notes in this, `tech`, debrief are about concrete software products and tech based on the theory from the `math` and `cs` debriefs.

## Theory vs praxis

The `tech` debrief hosts the notes about the practical side of computing, as contrasted by its theoretical twin described in the `math` and `cs` debriefs.

Contained within are the notes related to concrete software products, concrete technology and concrete programming language. These are the realizations of or rendered manifest thanks to the various theories they are based on.

For example, a topic like operating systems, is thus split into its theoretical aspects (explored in `cs` debrief), but its practical aspects, i.e. concrete OSs are described here, in large part in a manual-like manner. That is, all the general, shared and common properties of OSs are denoted in the theoretical `cs` debrief, while the concrete products (e.g. Ubuntu) are described in the `tech` debrief, usually in a manual-like but also in a guide-like manner (concrete steps to achive something).

As another example, a complex topic such as automated theorem proving, is, as usual, first split into its theoretical and prasctical aspects. But even its theoretical aspects are then spread across both `math` (i.e. type theory; theory of computation - formal languages; logic - proof theory) and `cs` debriefs (i.e. programming paradigms; features of programming languages). But it also appears multiple times in the tech debrief, from the section about the ecosystem of theorem provers, the section about the theorem provers based on the same type thoery, and finally in the topics about the concrete theorem provers (Agda, Coq, Lean, Isabelle).

In brief, some topics have a single natural location - and this is always prefered and strived for - while others had to be spread across multiple teritories. The assumption that the index will help in locating stuff is wrong.
