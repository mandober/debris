## DocBook

DocBook is a *schema* (available in several languages including `RELAX NG`, `SGML` and `XML DTD`s, and `W3C XML Schema`) maintained by the DocBook Technical Committee of OASIS. It is particularly well suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software (though it is by no means limited to these applications).

Because it is a large and robust schema, and because its main structures correspond to the general notion of what constitutes a "book", DocBook has been adopted by a large and growing community of authors writing books of all kinds.

DocBook is supported "out of the box" by a number of commercial tools, and there is rapidly expanding support for it in a number of free software environments. These features have combined to make DocBook a generally easy to understand, widely useful, and very popular schema. Dozens of organizations are using DocBook for millions of pages of documentation, in various print and online formats, worldwide.

SGML vs XML

The DocBook Technical Committee maintains both SGML and XML versions of the DocBook DTD and XML versions in several other languages. To the extent that it is practical, these DTDs are identical. There is no intentional difference between the DTDs, they are supposed to accept the same set of documents.
