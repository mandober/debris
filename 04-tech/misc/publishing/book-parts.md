Information essential to the main text is generally placed in a set of explanatory notes, or perhaps in an "Introduction" that may be paginated with Arabic numerals, rather than in the preface. The term preface can also mean any preliminary or introductory statement. It is sometimes abbreviated pref .

What is the difference between a preface and a foreword?
A preface is often signed (and the date and place of writing often follow the typeset signature); a foreword by another person is always signed. Information essential to the main text is generally placed in a set of explanatory notes, or perhaps in an "Introduction" that may be paginated with Arabic numerals, rather than in the preface.

Definition of foreword
: prefatory comments (as for a book) especially when written by someone other than the author 
: a section at the beginning of a book that introduces the book and is usually written by someone other than the book's author
: preface


*learn the ropes* To learn or understand the basic details of how to do or perform a job, task, or activity.

A *preamble* is an introductory and expressionary statement in a document that explains the document's purpose and underlying philosophy. When applied to the opening paragraphs of a statute, it may recite historical facts pertinent to the subject of the statute. It is distinct from the long title or enacting formula of a law.

An *abstract* is a brief summary of a research article, thesis, review, conference proceeding, or any in-depth analysis of a particular subject and is often used to help the reader quickly ascertain the paper's purpose. When used, an abstract always appears at the beginning of a manuscript or typescript, acting as the point-of-entry for any given academic paper

*Foreword*: This comes before all other content in the book. It isn't written by the Author. Most Authors don't need one.
*Preface*: This comes after the foreword and before the introduction. It's written by the Author. Most Authors don't need one.
*Introduction*: This is the beginning of your book's main text. It's written by the Author. Every nonfiction Author should have one in their book.

A foreword isn't part of the book's main text. It's part of the *front matter* aka all the stuff that comes before the book actually starts.

foreword vs blurb

blurb: a short description of a book, film, etc., written by the people who have produced it, and intended to make people want to buy it or see it:

*Half Title Page*
This is the first page of your book a reader sees. It has your book title with no subtitle or byline.

*Series Title Page*
If you've published other books, the second page is where you can list them by title. If you need to include the subtitle, you can, but it's not necessary.

*Frontispiece*
An illustration on the left (or verso) side of the page facing the title page on the right side (or recto). Originally, the frontispiece (from the French word frontispice) was purely decorative, using architectural elements such as columns and pediments, and went on the title page.

*Title Page*
This page has your title, subtitle, and byline.

*Copyright Page*
A page that shares the copyright information and may include: *Copyright statement*: This boilerplate text is mainly a formality, but many books include it.

*Disclaimer*: Based on the type of book you write, you can include various disclaimers on the copyright page to protect yourself from being sued by readers. Examples:
- Some parts of this book have been fictionalized in varying degrees, for the purposes of dramatization.
- Some parts of this book have been fictionalized in varying degrees, for various purposes.
- The information in this book is meant to supplement, not replace, proper mathematical training.

*Epigraph*
A short quotation that typically faces the table of contents or the first page of the book. Epigraphs can also be used to lead off chapters. Be sure to attribute the epigraph to its source.

*Table of Contents*
This page lists each of your chapters by title and includes the page number where they begin. If your book has sections, the section title should go above the chapters in that section.

*List of Illustrations/Figures*
Similar to a table of contents, this list includes the page numbers for your book's illustrations. Why you might need it: This page is useful only if your book includes illustrations that are critical to understanding your book's content (e.g. highly technical or science-focused books).

*List of Tables*
This page lists your tables and their corresponding page numbers. Why you might need it: Only if your tables are fundamental to understanding the book's content.

*List of Abbreviations or Chronology*
A list of commonly used *abbreviations* in your book, alphabetized by the abbreviation (not the spelled out words), and including the page number where the abbreviation is first used. A *chronology* is a timeline of events that are covered in your book.

*Second Half Title*
A second instance of the half title page used at the end of the *front matter*. Why you might need it: If your front matter is lengthy, a designer might add a second half title page to the front of your main text. Typically it's followed by a blank page or an epigraph.

*Index*
An alphabetical list of important terms used throughout your book. Unlike a glossary, definitions are not included, but rather the page numbers for every significant instance of that term. An index does not include every mention of a term because that kind of cumbersome list would be of little use to the reader. 

*Resources*
A list of organizations, associations, websites, books, podcasts, publications, and other sources of information that allow the reader to learn more about your subject.
