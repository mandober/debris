# Markdown specs

A text markup language (or, probably more precisely, a text formatting specification) called Markdown was invented by John Gruber. He wanted an austere format for writing unadorned prose, very close to the ASCII only format used in emails that had only a few broadly accepted ways of how to emphasize the parts of text while maintaining readability. Emails inspired the introduction of a quote block by using the sign `>`, as well as the use of asterisks to emphasize words.

Markdown was intended to be an unburdoned way to quickly write prose that could be easily converted into the proper HTML before publishing.

From the technological aspect, Markdown is just a collection of almost macro-like rules that use the ASCII-only symbols to introduce special treatment of designated text fragments. The email-inspired symbols to annotate the text fragments were chosen as to be easily distinguished from the normal text by a human reader, as well as to be as unambiguous as possible for the sake of quick parsing. In situations when ambiguities did arose, the backslash character was available for escaping purposes.

Markdown become rapidly popular and spawned a number of specs, also called flavors.

Markdown specs or flavors:
- The original spec by John Gruber
- CommonMark
- GitHub flavored Markdown
- GitLab flavored Markdown


* Daring Fireball: Markdown - the original specification of Markdown by John Gruber.
