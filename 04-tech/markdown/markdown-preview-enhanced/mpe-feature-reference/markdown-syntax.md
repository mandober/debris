## Footnotes

Footnotes are expressed with bracketed caret-names [^1], not only numbers; a return back link is auto added. The footnotes are organized at the bottom of the page and separated from the regular content by an auto inserted ruler.

## Abbreviation

Abbreviation seem like an interesting alternative to footnotes, saving the reader from jerking (the page) around. However, the marker is abbhorant. It may be possibly changed with a custom "local" CSS placed in the frontmatter.

An abbreviation definition starts with an asterix, but there is **no space** between it and the bracketed term. Then a colon, and the definition is given. The set of abrev. can be anywhere on a page, **it is not rendered**. The abbreviated words on the page are auto-located and decorated to show the tooltip, e.g. W3C and HTML and CSS.
