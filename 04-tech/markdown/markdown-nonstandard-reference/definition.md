# Markdown :: Non-standard reference :: Definition list

Some Markdown specs allow you to create definition lists.

A *definition lists* is a block consisting of multiple *entries*. Each entry is called a *definition* and consists of a single *definiens*, which is a term or a phrase being defined, and a *definiendum*, which is a phrase that defines it.

One way to create a definition list, is to specify the definiens a line, then start the next line with a colon and a space, followed by the definiendum.

Definiens
: This is the definiendum that provides the definition of the definiens.


First Term
: This is the definition of the first term.


Second Term
: This is one definition of the second term.
: This is another definition of the second term.
