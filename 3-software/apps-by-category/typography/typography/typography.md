# Typography

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible and appealing when displayed.

The arrangement of type involves selecting
- typefaces
- point sizes
- line lengths
- line heigths
- leading (space between lines)
- tracking (average space between letters)
- kerning (space between pairs of specific letters)

Typography also encompasses the style, arrangement, and appearance of the symbols (letters, numbers, and other characters) created in the typing process. *Type design* is a related craft, sometimes considered part of typography, that is about typeface design. Typography was once done exclusively by typesetters and typographers, but with digitalization this process became computerized and computer-aided, so today almost anyone can do it.

As the capability to create typography has become ubiquitous, the application of principles and best practices developed over generations of skilled workers and professionals has diminished. Today, when the need for effective typography is supported by the scientific evidence based on the limitations of human vision, typography, in the hands of the layman, is going down the drain, with its paramount goal of *absolute legibility* being regularly stomped over causing its principal objective of *effective communication* to fall on hard times.




State-of-the-art digital typographic systems have solved virtually all the demands of traditional typography and have expanded the possibilities with many new features.

Three systems are in common use:
* *OpenType* (OT) by Microsoft and Adobe
* *Apple Advanced Typography* (AAT) by Apple
* *Graphite* by SIL

* Graphite does not have a fixed set of features; instead it provides a way for fonts to define their own features.

* AAT and Graphite instructions can be embedded in OpenType font files ("smart font").

* The OpenType format is primarily intended for systems where the knowledge about the layout resides in the renderer (not in the font), although it does offer a few features that assist with complex text layout (CTL), such as contextual ligatures.
