# Input methods

## Directly with keyboard

- 
- maps a keyboard key with two characters (rarely more)
  - 26 kbd keys for A-Z, small/capital letter pairs


The plain old keyboard as an input method allows you to input only a relatively small number of characters, that are mapped more-less 1-to-1 to the ASCII character set. This is a comfortable way to type the small and capital letters of the Latin alphabet, along with a handful of punctuation symbols, and even two ways to enter numbers (top-row plus keypad).



directly; relatively small compared to Unicode, which of the version 14 has 



For example, the character encoding scheme
- ASCII comprises         128 code points in the range 0x00 to 0x7f
- Extended ASCII          256 code points in the range 0x00 to 0xff
- Unicode           1,114,112 code points in the range 0x00 to 0x10ffff


Unicode has lots of cool characters.  I mean lots and lots of cool
characters.  Enough characters to annoy all your friends with useless
charactery.  Your keyboard doesn't have nearly enough keys to input
all them.

In X - the GUI system used in Linux, BSD, Solaris &c. - there are a
number of different ways to input these extra characters.  Some are
suitable for occasional use: search for the character online or in a
character map program by name, then copy and paste it or enter its
number or name.  Some are suitable for frequent use: use a "3rd Level
Shift" (typically AltGr), dead keys, or input methods.  XCompose is an
intermediate solution: each character is typed using a mnemonic
combination of a few keystrokes.  It's not fast enough to use in every
word, but it's fairly easy to remember (or rediscover) for characters
you might use once a day or once a fortnight, and much less annoying
than having to search online that often.
