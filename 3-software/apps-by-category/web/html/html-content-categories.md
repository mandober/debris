# HTML Content Categories

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories


3 types of content categories:
* *Main*, which describe common rules shared by many elements.
* *Forms*, which describe rules common to form-related elements.
* *Specific*, which describe rare categories shared only by a few elements, sometimes only in a specific context.
* *Transparent* content model: such element must have its contents structured so they would be valid HTML 5, even if the transparent element were removed and replaced by the child elements.
