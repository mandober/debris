# HTML Introduction

**HyperText Markup Language**, **HTML**, the most basic layer of web platform, is used to describe the structure (and semantics) of web pages. Its actual version, HTML 5.0, has manged to slightly improve the semantic aspect of web pages by defining new semantic HTML elements, like `header`, `article` and similar, although web sites are still full of pages that suffer from overuse of the semantics-lacking `div` tags.

HTML is a static markup language that lacks any logic and it just roughly places structural (and semantic) elements of the document. CSS is then used to control the appearance and presentation, while JavaScript is used to add functionality and behaviour.

The term *hypertext* refers to the links that connect web pages. Links are the fundamental aspect of the Web, enabling easy (cross) referencing and breaking the linearity of a document into a multi-level linked, *hyper*, document.

HTML uses markup text to delinate containers where a document's content (text and media) is to be placed, eventually being displayed in consumer's browsers.

HTML has progressed to offer more granular choice in selecting the appropriate element for a content. It includes elements such as: `<head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>` and many others.

An HTML element is set off from the surrounding text by the so-called HTML *tags*, which consist of a case-insensitive element's name inside the angle-brackets.
