# Canvas



The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D and 3D shapes and bitmap images. It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap and does not have a built-in scene graph. It provides an empty graphic zone on which specific JavaScript APIs can draw (such as Canvas 2D or WebGL).
