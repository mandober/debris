## JavaScript and its environment


The traditional host environment to embed JavaScript are browsers, and JavaScript language specification makes no significant effort to clearly demarcate when it stops and its host environment begins.

Namely, the host environment can provide as little or as much of additional functionality to JavaScript as it wants. JavaScript has for so long been tied to browsers that we tend to think of all that functionality as coming with the JavaScript language itself.

However, the fact is that there is *JavaScript the language*, which is then augmented with the extra functionality that a particular host environment provides. That extra functionality goes under the name **Web API**.

A large number of Web APIs is available to developers for web programming. These APIs may be roughly classified as WebAPIs and Web interfaces, and they include numerous additional functionalities such as DOM, CSSOM, Clipboard API, History API, Page Visibility API, Geolocation API, along with functions like `alert` `setTimeout`, `prompt`.
