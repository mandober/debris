The WHATWG works on a number of technologies that are fundamental parts of the *web platform*. They are organised somewhat arbitrarily based on the preferences of those editing the standard for those technologies.

## Compatibility
The Compatibility Standard describes a collection of non-standard (and often vendor-prefixed) CSS properties and DOM APIs that web browsers need to support for compatibility with the de facto web.

## Console
The Console Standard defines APIs for console debugging facilities.

## DOM
The DOM Standard defines the core infrastructure used to define the web.

## Encoding
The Encoding Standard defines how character encodings work on the web.

## Fetch
The Fetch Standard defines the networking model for resource retrieval on the web.

## Fullscreen API
The Fullscreen API Standard defines how web pages can take over a user's entire screen (at the user's request), e.g. for gaming or to watch a video.

## HTML
The HTML Standard is a kitchen sink full of technologies for the web. It includes the core markup language for the web, HTML, as well as numerous APIs like Web Sockets, Web Workers, localStorage, etc.

## Infra
The Infra Standard aims to define the fundamental concepts upon which standards are built.

## MIME Sniffing
The MIME Sniffing Standard defines algorithms used to determine the type of resources.

## Notifications API
The Notifications API Standard provides an API to display notifications to alert users outside the context of a web page.

## Quirks Mode
The Quirks Mode Standard describes behaviours in CSS and Selectors that are not yet defined in the relevant specifications but that are nonetheless widely implemented.

## Storage
The Storage Standard defines an API for persistent storage and quota estimates, as well as the platform storage architecture.

## Streams
The Streams Standard provides APIs for creating, composing, and consuming streams of data that map efficiently to low-level I/O primitives.

## URL
The URL Standard defines the infrastructure around URLs on the web.

## XMLHttpRequest
The XMLHttpRequest Standard defines the networking API exposed to scripts on the web.
