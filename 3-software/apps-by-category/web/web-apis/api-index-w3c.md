**ActivityPub** is an open, decentralized social networking protocol based on Pump.io's ActivityPump protocol. It provides a client/server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server-to-server API for delivering notifications and content.

**Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)** is a technical specification published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that specifies how to increase the accessibility of web pages, in particular, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

**Canonical XML** is a normal form of XML, intended to allow relatively simple comparison of pairs of XML documents for equivalence; for this purpose, the Canonical XML transformation removes non-meaningful differences between the documents. Any XML document can be converted to Canonical XML.

**Compound Document Format (CDF)** is a set of W3C candidate standards describing electronic compound document file formats that contains multiple formats, such as SVG, XHTML, SMIL and XForms. The core standards are the Web Integration Compound Document and the Compound Document by Reference Framework (CDR). As of August 19, 2010, the Compound Document Format working group has been closed, and W3C's development of the standard discontinued.

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

**Document Object Model (DOM)** is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document.

**The W3C Geolocation API** is an effort by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to standardize an interface to retrieve the geographical location information for a client-side device. It defines a set of objects, ECMAScript standard compliant, that executing in the client application give the client's device location through the consulting of Location Information Servers, which are transparent for the application programming interface (API).

**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

**HTML5** is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup based pattern to it.

**The Internationalization Tag Set (ITS)** is a set of attributes and elements designed to provide internationalization and localization support in XML documents.

**JSON-LD JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data**, is a method of encoding Linked Data using JSON. It was a goal to require as little effort as possible from developers to transform their existing JSON to JSON-LD. This allows data to be serialized in a way that is similar to traditional JSON. It is a World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation.

**Linked Data Notifications (LDN)** is a W3C Recommendation that describes a communications protocol based on HTTP, URI, and RDF on how servers (receivers) can receive messages pushed to them by applications (senders), as well as how other applications (consumers) may retrieve those messages.

**Micropub (MP)** is a W3C Recommendation that describes a client–server protocol based on HTTP to create, update, and delete posts (e.g. social media) on servers using web or native app clients. Micropub was originally developed in the IndieWebCamp community, contributed to W3C, and published as a W3C working draft on 2016-01-28. As of 2017-05-23 it is a W3C Recommendation.

**The Web Ontology Language (OWL)** is a family of knowledge representation languages for authoring ontologies. Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects. Ontologies resemble class hierarchies in object-oriented programming but there are several critical differences.

**The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P)** is an *obsolete* protocol allowing websites to declare their intended use of information they collect about web browser users. Designed to give users more control of their personal information when browsing, P3P was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and officially recommended on April 16, 2002. Development ceased shortly thereafter and there have been very few implementations of P3P.

**The Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS)** is a W3C Recommendation, which is designed to enable interoperable specification of pronunciation information for both speech recognition and speech synthesis engines within voice browsing applications. The language is intended to be easy to use by developers while supporting the accurate specification of pronunciation information for international use.

**The Resource Description Framework (RDF)** is a family of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications originally designed as a metadata data model. It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in web resources, using a variety of syntax notations and data serialization formats. It is also used in knowledge management applications.

**RDF Schema or Resource Description Framework Schema**, variously abbreviated as RDFS, RDF(S), RDF-S, or RDF/S) is a set of classes with certain properties using the RDF extensible knowledge representation data model, providing basic elements for the description of ontologies, otherwise called RDF vocabularies, intended to structure RDF resources. These resources can be saved in a triplestore to reach them with the query language SPARQL.

**Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition (SISR)** defines the syntax and semantics of annotations to grammar rules in the Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS). Since 5 April 2007, it is a World Wide Web Consortium recommendation.

**Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)** is a W3C recommendation designed for representation of thesauri, classification schemes, taxonomies, subject-heading systems, or any other type of structured controlled vocabulary. SKOS is part of the Semantic Web family of standards built upon RDF and RDFS, and its main objective is to enable easy publication and use of such vocabularies as linked data.

**Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language SMIL** is a World Wide Web Consortium recommended Extensible Markup Language (XML) markup language to describe multimedia presentations. It defines markup for timing, layout, animations, visual transitions, and media embedding, among other things. SMIL allows presenting media items such as text, images, video, audio, links to other SMIL presentations, and files from multiple web servers. SMIL markup is written in XML, and has similarities to HTML.

**SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol** is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to provide extensibility, neutrality and independence.
