# InnoDB

- has *row-level locking*
- has *referential integrity*: supports *foreign keys*, *relation constraints*
- has *transactions*: *commits* and *rollbacks*
- has greater reliability as it uses *transactional logs* for *auto recovery*


## MyISAM

- MyISAM only has full table-level locking
- no referential integrity
- no transactions
- no auto recovery
