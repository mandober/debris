# Markdown flavors

List to document all Markdown syntax variations (rather than implementations). There is a list of Markdown implementations on the Markdown GitHub Organization which could be reviewed to find further flavors to add to this list.



## Markdown artefacts

The original, John Grubr's, Markdown specification of the syntax seems to have been enough vague to create this MD explosion of specs, flavors and extensions.

The original spec is silent or vague on many issues and corner cases, plus the various markdown implementations have diverged per se in their interpretations of the original syntax spec. All of that has contributed to the situation that today we have numerous mutually-incompatible markdown flavors and aps based on them, along with a slew of various small extensions that introduce arbitrary characters into the syntax that is already sufficiently messy to be parsed unambiguously, let alone efficiently.

Each attempt to standirdize markdown wasn't strong or efficient enough to be the final one, so the total number of markown standards keeps increasing. It hasn't even been possible to come up with a base standard, which the various MD fractions could together work on.

Besides the standardization efforts that produces many independent markdown syntax specs, there are many small markdown extensions, often jsut hacked onto some existing markdown implementation, and often external to the existing specs. Some specs have, however, been versioned to accepts these extensions.

Markdown flavors are more-less equivalent to the Markdown specifications, only some are perhaps presented in a less organized way. Call 'em specs in the wild.
