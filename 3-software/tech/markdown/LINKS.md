A tool for comparing the output of various implementations of John Gruber's markdown syntax for plain text documents. The official markdown syntax documentation is silent or vague on many issues, and implementations have diverged in their interpretations of the syntax. Even when the interpretation of the syntax spec is not in question, implementations may have bugs. So it is useful to be able to see at a glance how implementations differ on various inputs. The hope is that this tool will promote discussion of how and whether certain vague aspects of the markdown spec should be clarified.
