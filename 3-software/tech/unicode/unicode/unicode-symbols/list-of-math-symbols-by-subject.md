⊖ Symmetric difference: that is, `A ⊖ B` is the set formed by the elements that belong to exactly one of the two sets A and B. Notation `A Δ B`.

∁
1. With a subscript, denotes a set complement: if B ⊆ A, then `∁ᴀB = A∖B`
2. Without a subscript, denotes the absolute complement: `∁A = CᴜA`, where U is a set implicitly defined by the context, which contains all sets under consideration. This set U is sometimes called the universe of discourse.

⊔
Denotes the disjoint union. That is, if A and B are two sets, `A ⊔ B = A ⋃ C`, where C is a set formed by the elements of B renamed to not belong to A.

∐
1. An alternative to ⊔ for denoting disjoint union.
2. Denotes the coproduct of mathematical structures or of objects in a category

Hadamard product of matrices: if A and B are two matrices of the same size, then `A∘B` is the matrix such that 

$$(A\circ B)_{i,j}=(A)_{i,j}(B)_{i,j}$$

Possibly, `∘` is also used instead of `⊙` for the Hadamard product of power series.
