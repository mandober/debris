# TeX :: Basics

## Tags

Markdown used in this repo is edited in VS Code with `Markdown Extended Preview` extension, which enables, among other things, authoring with latex-like syntax using `MathJax` or `KaTeX`. Each one has its differences, between each other and compared with Latex.

here does not use proper latex but MathJax, which is similar but also has significant differences. This reference is for MathJax.

Use only `$$` for start and end latex tags. Instead of `$$$` for block formatting, use `$$` with `\displaystyle` as the first line.
