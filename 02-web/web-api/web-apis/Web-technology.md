# Web technology for developers

The open Web presents incredible opportunities for developers. To take full advantage of these technologies, you need to know how to use them. Below you'll find links to our Web technology documentation.

## Documentation for Web developers

### Web Developer Guide
The Web Developer Guide provides useful how-to content to help you actually use Web technologies to do what you want or need to do.

### Tutorials for Web developers
Tutorials to take you step-by-step through learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs.

### Accessibility
Enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.

### Performance
Making content as available and interactive as possible, as soon as possible.

### Security
Protecting users from data leaks and data theft, side-channel attacks, and attacks such as cross-site scripting, content injection, and click-jacking.


## Web technology references

### Web APIs
JavaScript programming APIs you can use to build apps on the Web.

### HTML
HTML provides the fundamental building blocks for structuring Web documents and apps.

### CSS
Cascading Style Sheets are used to describe the appearance of Web documents and apps.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is the Web's native programming language.

### WebAssembly
WebAssembly allows programs written in C, C++, Rust, Swift, C#, Go, and more to run on the Web.

### Events
Events are what you build Web apps to react to; for example, when a Web page finishes loading, or a user selects something, presses a key, resizes a window, submits a form, or pauses a video.

### HTTP
HTTP is the fundamental Internet protocol for fetching documents, stylesheets, scripts, images, videos, fonts, and other resources over the Web - and for sending data back to Web servers.

### Media
Formats, codecs, protocols, APIs, and techniques for embedding and streaming video, audio, and image content in Web documents and apps.

### SVG
Scalable Vector Graphics lets you create images that scale smoothly to any size.

### MathML
MathML lets you display complex mathematical notation on the Web.

### Web Components
Web Components are custom elements that you can define and reuse in your Web apps.

### WebDriver
WebDriver is a browser-automation mechanism for remotely controlling a browser by emulating the actions of a real person using the browser. It's widely used for cross-browser testing of Web apps.

### Web Extensions
Web Extensions are a way for you to give users enhanced capabilities in their browsers - for doing things such as blocking ads and other content, customizing the appearance of pages, and more.

### Web App Manifests
Web App Manifests let you enable users to install Web apps to their device home screens, with aspects such as portrait/landscape screen orientation and display mode (e.g., full screen) pre-set.

### Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
Progressive Web Apps provide a user experience similar to native mobile apps.
