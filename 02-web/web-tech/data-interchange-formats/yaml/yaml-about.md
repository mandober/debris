YAML is considered a data-serialization language

"YAML" is a recursive acronym for YAML Ain't Markup Language. The motive to swing that way after the GNU recursive acronym have already been used once remains unknown.


YAML is a less of a language and more of a format



**YAML** is a human-readable *data-serialization language*.


YAML is a data-serialization language

YAML may be used
- as a data-serialization format and language
- data-exchange format and language
- configuration format and language

YAML is a (syntax) format, rather then a (markup) language
YAML is not a markup language

YAML is a configuration language


YAML is used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

YAML targets many of the same communications applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal syntax which intentionally differs from SGML.

It uses both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses `[...]` for lists and `{...}` for maps.

JSON files are valid YAML 1.2.

Custom data types are allowed, but 
YAML natively encodes 
scalars (such as strings, integers, and floats), 
lists, and 
associative arrays (also known as maps, dictionaries or hashes). 

These data types are based on Perl, 
though all commonly used high-level programming languages 
share very similar concepts.

The *colon-centered syntax*, used for expressing key-value pairs, is inspired by electronic mail headers as defined in RFC 822, and the *document separator* (`---`) is borrowed from MIME (RFC 2046). 

*Escape sequences* are reused from C, 
*whitespace wrapping* for *multi-line strings* is inspired by HTML. 

Lists and hashes can contain nested lists and hashes, forming a tree structure.

Arbitrary graphs can be represented using *YAML aliases* (similar to XML in SOAP).

YAML is intended to be read and written in *streams*, a feature inspired by SAX.

Support for reading and writing YAML is available for many programming languages.

Some source-code editors such as Vim, Emacs, and various integrated development environments have features that make editing YAML easier, such as folding up nested structures or automatically highlighting syntax errors.

The official recommended filename extension for YAML files is `.yaml` since 2006.
