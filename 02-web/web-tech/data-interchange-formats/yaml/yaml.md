# YAML

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a markup language intended for data serialisation and data exchange.

YAML attempts to make the markup more user-friendly, primarily by making the syntax less verbose. It requires a lot less ceremony to keep the data unambiguously parsable.

YAML is a strict superset of JSON, with the addition of syntactically significant newlines and indentation (a la Haskell). However, indentation must be made of spaces (U+0020); the use of the literal tab character (U+0009) for this purpose is disallowed.
