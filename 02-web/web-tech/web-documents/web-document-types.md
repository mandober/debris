Tim Berners-Lee created the Web in 1989 as part of a project at the Swiss scientific center CERN. hypertext system. This project was built on previous successes, such as Ted Nelson's Xanadu project. The first display application resembled a cross between a browser and an editor. Tim simply called it the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee created this application on a NeXT computer in the fall of 1990. He dubbed this program Nexus so that it would not be mistaken with the later emerging World Wide Web. With this program, just texts could be displayed at first. Several vendors, however, added the capacity to display images in the years that followed. The Mosaic browser for X, introduced in 1993, is responsible for the Web's quick growth and popularity.
