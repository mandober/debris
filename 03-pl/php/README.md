PHP reference: summaries, details, gotchas, reminders, how-tos, indices, listings, tl/dr, cheatsheets, all along the code tower. Strive toward:
- quick topical overviews followed by detailed explorations
- listings galore (index of funcs, keywords, etc.)
- embedded topical code snippets, often repated in the proper source files
