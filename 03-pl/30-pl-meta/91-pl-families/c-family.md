# PL :: Families :: C language family

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages

Due to the success of the C PL and some of its derivatives, *C-family PLs* span a large variety of programming paradigms, conceptual models, and run-time environments. These languages are described as being *C-like*, being *dialects of C*, having *C-like syntax*, or otherwise being similar to C.

Such PLs are likely to share some syntax and basic language constructs with C
- semicolon-terminated statements
- brace-delimited code blocks
- parentheses-delimited parameters
- infix-notated arithmetical and logical expressions

The use of curly-bracket (`{}`) to denote blocks of code has led to the name curly-bracket languages being sometimes used.
