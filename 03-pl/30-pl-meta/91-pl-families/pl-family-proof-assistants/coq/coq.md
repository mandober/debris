# Coq

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq

- interactive theorem prover
- first released in 1989
- named after its principal developer, Thierry Coquand
- https://coq.inria.fr/
- written in OCaml, a bit of C
- plug-in extendable

* It allows for the expression of mathematical assertions, mechanically checks proofs of these assertions, helps to find formal proofs, and extracts a certified program from the constructive proof of its formal specification.

* Coq works within the *theory of the calculus of inductive constructions*, a derivative of the *calculus of constructions*.

* Coq is not an *automated theorem prover* but includes automatic theorem proving tactics (procedures) and various decision procedures.


Coq as a PL
- functional programming language
- dependent types

Coq as a logical system
- implements a higher-order type theory

* Coq provides a specification language called `Gallina`. Programs written in Gallina have the *weak normalization property*, implying that they always terminate.
