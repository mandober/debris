Epigram is a FPL with
- dependent types
- IDE packaged with the language

Epigram's type system is strong enough to express program specifications. The goal is to support a smooth transition from ordinary programming to integrated programs and proofs which correctness can be checked and certified by the compiler. Epigram exploits the Curry-Howard correspondence. Epigram is based on intuitionistic type theory.

The Epigram prototype was implemented by Conor McBride based on joint work with James McKinna. Its development is continued by the Epigram group in UK.

The current experimental implementation of the Epigram system is freely available together with a user manual, a tutorial and some background material.

The Epigram system has support for Linux, Windows and macOS.

Epigram is currently *unmaintained*, and version 2, which was intended to implement **Observational Type Theory**, was never officially released but exists in GitHub.

The design of Epigram and *Epigram 2* have inspired the development Agda, Idris,and Coq.
