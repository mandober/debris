# Idris

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_(programming_language)

Characteristics:
- general-purpose PL
- functional programming language (FPL)
- purely-functional (pFPL)
- dependent types
- optional lazy evaluation
- garbage collector

Extra features:
- totality checker
- may be used as a proof assistant

Proof assistant
- similar to Agda
- proofs similar to Coq including tactics (theorem proving functions/procedures) via elaborator reflection.

* Compared to Agda and Coq, Idris prioritizes management of side effects and support for eDSL (embedded domain-specific languages)

* Idris compiles to C (uses custom copying garbage collector with Cheney's algorithm) and JavaScript (browser and Node). 3rd-party code generators for other platforms (JVM, CIL, LLVM) are available.

* Idris is named after a singing dragon from the 1970s UK children's television program Ivor the Engine.
