# TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers classes, modules, and interfaces to help you build robust components.


- Type annotations can be optional in TypeScript 
- TypeScript uses structural typing
- has some support for type inference
- supports interfaces, which are reusable (as opposed to inline) typings that you can apply in various ways to annotate APIs and function signatures.
- A single interface can have many implementations.
