A type system of PL is an implementation of some concrete type theory. A language with strong type system that is usually used to compare type systems against in Haskell's, if the dependent types are not needed, otherwise even more advanced types systems are needed such as the ones found in dependently-typed language like Agda, Idris, Coq.
