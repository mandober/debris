# TS :: Ref :: Types :: Enums

https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html

Enums are one of the few features TypeScript has which is not a type-level extension of JavaScript.

>Enums allows defining a set of named constants.

Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

`enum` is a way of naming numbers. By default, numbering starts at 0. You can change this by manually setting the value of a member.
