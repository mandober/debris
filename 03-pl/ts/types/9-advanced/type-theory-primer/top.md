# TS :: Type System :: Top type

In type theory, a theory within mathematical logic, the bottom type of a type system is the type that is a subtype of all other types.[1]

Where such a type exists, it is often represented with the up tack (‚ä•) symbol.

When the bottom type is empty, a function whose return type is bottom cannot return any value, not even the lone value of a unit type. In such a language, the bottom type may therefore be known as the zero or never type. In the Curry-Howard correspondence, an empty type corresponds to falsity.
