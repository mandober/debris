# Type system

*Type theory* today comprises an enormous number of specific type theories, all stemming from a large number of factors, some fundamental, some less so. Almost every characteristic splits type theories into those that have it and those that do not. Therefore, it is very hard to define the core, the most common denominator of sorts, that all type theories have in common, but they do at least share some basic concepts.

A *type system* is a particular realization of a specific type theory as it is implemented in a programming language. Many languages are even created just to take a specific type theory for a drive. Each strongly-typed language (pretty much meaning a language with a serious type system) implements a specific type theory. All strongly-typed languages implement a specific type theory and almost all were created with a specific type theory in mind for theor type system.

The flavor of type theory pertaining to the TypeScript's type system seems unclear, but its type system still shares many commonalities with type systems in general.

It is hard to compare a type theory to the type-theoretical concepts as they are described in mathematics, most of all because math does not have a stand 

of a language against 

the mathematical notation


A language that is commonly used 



A language with strong type system that is usually used to compare type systems against in Haskell's, if the dependent types are not needed, otherwise even more advanced types systems are needed such as the ones found in dependently-typed language like Agda, Idris, Coq.
