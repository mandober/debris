# Algebraic data types

- About ADTs, the concept of ADTs
  - connection with arithmetic, logic, set theory
  - cardinality of sets and types
- determining components of the 4-tuple `(0, 1, +, тип)` in TS types
  - zero: empty set / empty type
  - one: singleton set / unit type
  - products: Cartesian product / tuples
    - TS tuples: tuple values and tuple types
  - sums: disjoint union / tagged union
    - issues with tagged union representations
    - tagged or discriminating union in TS
- ADT features
  - GADTs
  - pattern matching
  - exhaustiveness check
