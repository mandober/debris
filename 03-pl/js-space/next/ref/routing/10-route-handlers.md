# Route handlers

https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers

Route Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the web *Request* and *Response* APIs.

Route Handlers are only available inside the `app` dir. They are the equivalent of *API Routes* inside the `pages` dir, meaning you do not need to use API Routes and Route Handlers together.
