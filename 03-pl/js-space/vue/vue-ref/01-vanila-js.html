    With vanilla JS binding HTML nodes in JS is a lot of work:
    to bind an input field's value to a var in JS, so that any change
    of that input gets instantly reflected in JS, requires going into 
    the DOM to fetch the current input's value. And to always get the
    current value also requires setting an event listener to the input's 
    onChange behaviour. And that only gets us a one-way binding, with the
    input always being "the source of truth"; one directopn: node -> JS
    To set up two-way binding such that changes in either the input or the
    JS variable reflect on each other, demands further work. The Vue makes
    this simple, providing an easy to set-up two-way bindings.

    <!-- input with id 'input'; it must come before the js -->
    <input type="text" id="input">
    
     <!-- js come after the input -->
    <script>
      let message = "vanilla js";
      // get node with id 'input' and set its value to `message` JS variable
      document.querySelector("#input").value = message;
