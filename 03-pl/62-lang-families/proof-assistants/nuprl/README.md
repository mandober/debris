## The RedPRL Proof Assistant

`RedPRL` is an experimental proof assistant based on *cubical computational type theory*, which extends the [Nuprl][nuprl] semantics by higher-dimensional features inspired by homotopy type theory.

[RedPRL][redprl] is created and maintained by the RedPRL Development Team. It is written in [Standard ML][sml] and available for download on [GitHub][gitred].
