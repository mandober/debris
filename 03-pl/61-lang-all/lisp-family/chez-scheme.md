# Chez Scheme

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chez_Scheme

**Chez Scheme** is a dialect and implementation of the programming language *Scheme*, which itself is a type of *Lisp*.

- Chez Scheme uses an incremental native-code compiler to produce native binaries for the x86 (IA-32, x86-64), PowerPC and SPARC architectures.
- Chez Scheme supports the `R6RS` standard since version 7.9.1.
- Chez Scheme was first released in 1985, by R. Kent Dybvig, as a proprietary software, but was open-sourced with 9.4 version, released on 2016-05-13.
- *Petite Chez Scheme* is a sibling implementation which uses a threaded interpreter design instead of Chez Scheme's incremental native-code compiler.
- Programs written for Chez Scheme run unchanged in Petite Chez Scheme provided they don't rely on the compiler intrinsics (e.g. FFI).
