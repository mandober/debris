# Empty type

The type that corresponds to the number 0 should have no elements at all, i.e. it is *uninhabited*. Such type is called *the zero type*¹ or *the empty type* and it may be denoted by `𝟘`, `Zero`, `Empty`. The zero type may seem not very useful, and it really is not often used, but it has it moments.
