# Creating new types

- object types
- union types
- intersection types
- tuple types
- function types


In TS, the keywords for creating new types are `interface` and `type`.

The `interface` keyword is primarily used for defining object types, while the `type` keyword is used for defining any type, including *object types*, *union types*, and *intersection types*.




One key difference between using `extends` and `&` is that `extends` creates a new type that has an inheritance relationship with the parent type, while `&` creates a new type that is a combination of two or more existing types without any inheritance relationship.
