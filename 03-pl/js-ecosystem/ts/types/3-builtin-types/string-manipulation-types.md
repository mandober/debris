# TS :: Types :: Intrinsic string manipulation types

Intrinsic string manipulation types
- Uppercase<StringType>
- Lowercase<StringType>
- Capitalize<StringType>
- Uncapitalize<StringType>

Intrinsic string manipulation types are used with *literal string types* and *literal template types*.

"Intrinsic" means that these are implemented by the compiler, which can be confirmed by looking at their definitions - the right hand side, where a definitio ngoes, only contains a marker.
