## Styling

Next.js supports different ways of styling your application, including:

* *Global CSS*: 
  Simple to use and familiar for those experienced with traditional CSS, but can lead to larger CSS bundles and difficulty managing styles as the application grows.

* *CSS Modules*: 
  Create locally scoped CSS classes to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.

* *Tailwind CSS*: 
  A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid custom designs by composing utility classes.

* *Sass*: 
  A popular CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins.

* *CSS-in-JS*:
  Embed CSS directly in your JavaScript components, enabling dynamic and scoped styling.
