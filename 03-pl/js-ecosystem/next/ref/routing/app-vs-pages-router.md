# App Router vs Pages Router

https://nextjs.org/docs#app-router-vs-pages-router

Next.js has two different routers:
- App Router
- Pages Router

*App Router* is a newer router that allows you to use React's latest features, such as Server Components and Streaming.

*Pages Router* is the original Next.js router, which allowed you to build server-rendered React apps and continues to be supported for older apps.
