## TL/DR

Things pertaining to the canvas HTML element manipulated with JS

This section is primarily about using the canvas HTML element and JS, first, in order to illustrate trigonometric concepts, and things like a coordinate systems, unit circle, vectors (Ã  la graphing calculator), gradually moving towards the exploration and simulation of simple physical systems, such as bouncing balls, colliding objects, pendulum, orbits, and shit, simulating forces like gravity, drag and friction. Basically, quasi physics via JS canvas.
