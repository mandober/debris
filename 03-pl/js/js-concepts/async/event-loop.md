# Event Loop

## TL/DR
If you think you will understand the JS event loop after this post, oh boy are you in for a surprise. Promised nothing gained nothing. Garbage in ragebag out. Does not mention callback hell more than trice (So… so, you think you can tell, a callback from hell), coz trice as nice.

queue              ⟳              rAF S N P
