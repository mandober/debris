# JS TERMS

## Machine primitives

- machine primitive values
  - bit, bits, bitstring, bit-pattern
  - bitstrings (bit-patterns, groups of bits) constitute values
  - all machine primitive values are numeric (not Booelan)
  - groups of bits with particular interpretation
  - but all can be interpreted as numbers (integers)

- 4 elementary machine types:
  1. Integers (by signededness, by size)
  2. Pointer (int as memory address)
  3. Character (int as char encoding)
  4. Floats (single and double precision)

- word (bitness, 64-bit)
- bit/pattern-pattern, bit/bytestring
- machine integers
  - by signedness
    - unsigned integers
    - signed integers
  - by bit size (by bit width)
    - 8-bit
    - 16-bit
    - 32-bit
    - 64-bit
    - 128-bit
