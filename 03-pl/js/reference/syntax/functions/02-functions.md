# Functionsfunctionanonymous functionclosure## Arrow functionsAn arrow function (lambda) evaluates to a closure.A closure is a pair of a code pointer and an environment. It is an object "inside the machine" that exists at runtime.A lambda expression is a syntactic entity, a piece of source code: something you can see on the screen.A lambda expression evaluates to a closure, just as an integer literal (a string of digits) evaluates to an integer, or a 'new' expression evaluates to an instance (object).
