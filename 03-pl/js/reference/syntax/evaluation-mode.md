# Evaluation Mode

Evaluation mode may be related to the strict vs sloppy mode, or the **evaluation goal**, that is, whether the source is compiled as module or a plain script. ES Modules are in strict mode by default.

Evaluation goals
- module (compile source as module, always in strict mode)
- script (compile source as plain old script)

Evaluation modes
- sloppy mode: default mode
- strict mode: opt-in at new file or function scope
