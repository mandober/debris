# SpiderMonkey

SpiderMonkey is Mozilla's JavaScript and WebAssembly Engine, used in Firefox, Servo and various other projects. It is written in C++, Rust and JavaScript. You can embed it into C++ and Rust projects, and it can be run as a stand-alone shell. It can also be compiled to WASI; see our online demo.
