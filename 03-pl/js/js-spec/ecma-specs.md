# JS :: ECMAScript 262 Specification

## Specification document

The specs document at [ESNext spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage) is the most accurate and up-to-date ECMAScript specification. It contains the content of the most recent yearly snapshot plus any finished proposals (those that have reached Stage 4 in the proposal process and thus are implemented in several implementations and will be in the next practical revision) since that snapshot was taken.
