## EcmaScript 1
The first version of the language standard.

## EcmaScript 2
This version was produced in 1998 when the language was also standardized by ISO/IEC. It updated the Ecma standard so that it would match the document produced by ISO/IEC.

## EcmaScript 3
**major updates**
In 1999 there were several new features being added to the language. The most conspicuous were:
- Regular expression literals
- New control statements
- Exception handling

## EcmaScript 4
This version draft was abandoned in 2008 due to disagreements about its feature set. It was decided that the output was too radical to be introduced and there was an agreement to create an intermediate version before such drastic developments would take place.

## EcmaScript 4.1
Abandoned, but some of the features intended for this version came in later.

## EcmaScript 5
**major updates**
The version that every browser (since 2016) supports. Created in 2009. Its most noticeable features were:
- High-order iteration functions (map, reduce, filter, forEach);
- JSON support;
- Getters and setters;
- Better reflection and object properties

## EcmaScript 5.1
Just like EcmaScript 2, this spec was produced to align the Ecma standard with the document that was produced by ISO/IEC for EcmaScript 5.

## EcmaScript 6
**major updates**
EcmaScript 6 (AKA ES6, EcmaScript 2015, Harmony)
This version added several big changes in 2015, namely:
- Promises
- Modules
- Classes
- Block-scoped variable declarations (let)
- Arrow functions
- Template literal
- Spread operator
- De-structuring assignment
- Parameter default values
- Rest parameters
- Symbols
- Generator functions

## EcmaScript 2016
EcmaScript 2016 (AKA ES7)
This version only made minor changes to the language, such as adding an exponentiation operator and specifying the <Array.includes> method.

The browser support for this version is incomplete though there is a transpiler that converts ES6 code into older ES versions.


## 7th Edition - ECMAScript 2016
The 7th edition, officially known as ECMAScript 2016, was finalized in June 2016. The major standard language features include block-scoping of variables and functions, destructuring patterns (of variables), proper tail calls, exponentiation operator `**` for numbers, `await`, `async` keywords for asynchronous programming.


## 8th Edition - ECMAScript 2017
The 8th edition, officially known as ECMAScript 2017, was finalized in June 2017. Includes `async`/`await` constructions, which work using generators and promises. ECMAScript 2017 (ES2017), the eighth edition, includes features for concurrency and atomics, syntactic integration with promises (async/await).


## 9th Edition - ECMAScript 2018
The 9th edition, officially known as ECMAScript 2018, was finalized in June 2018. New features include rest/spread operators for variables (`...identifier`), asynchronous iteration, `Promise.prototype.finally()` and additions to `RegExp`.


## 10th Edition - ECMAScript 2019
The 10th edition, officially known as ECMAScript 2019, was published in June 2019. Added features include, but are not limited to, `Array.prototype.flat`, `Array.prototype.flatMap`, changes to `Array.sort` (creates new array) and `Object.fromEntries`.

## 11th Edition - ECMAScript 2020
(work in progress)


## ES.Next
ES.Next is a dynamic name that refers to whatever the next version is at the time of writing. ES.Next features are finished proposals (aka "stage 4 proposals") as listed at finished proposal that are not part of a ratified specification. The language committee follows a "living spec" model so these changes are part of the standard and ratification is a formality
