# Agda :: Index :: Unicode symbols

Sometimes you find yourself scratching the screen trying to remove an irritatingly persistant speck o'dirt, for Agda is balls deeps into Unicode, no matter how miniscule, butt ugly and unreadable the glyphs get.

To type such symbols, agda-mode for emacs, and its vscode port, feature a similar mechanism for inputting Unicode glyphs: trigger the symbol typing mode by hitting the backslash (by default), then type a sequence of keys, a la compose (wincompose), that spell out the symbol's Latex name or resamble the desired glyph in a metaphysical sense symbolically speaking.

- `\ t o p` for `⊤`
- `\ e l l` for `ℓ`
- `/ S i g m a   / _ 2` for `Σ₂`
