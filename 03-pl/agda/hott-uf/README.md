## Abstract

We introduce Voevodsky's univalent foundations and univalent mathematics, and explain how to develop them with the computer system Agda, which is based on Martin-L√∂f type theory. Agda allows us to write mathematical definitions, constructions, theorems and proofs, for example in number theory, analysis, group theory, topology, category theory or programming language theory, checking them for logical and mathematical correctness.

Agda is a constructive mathematical system by default, which amounts to saying that it can also be considered as a programming language for manipulating mathematical objects. But we can assume the axiom of choice or the principle of excluded middle for pieces of mathematics that require them, at the cost of losing the implicit programming-language character of the system. For a fully constructive development of univalent mathematics in Agda, we would need to use its new cubical flavour, and we hope these notes provide a base for researchers interested in learning cubical type theory and cubical Agda as the next step.

Compared to most expositions of the subject, we work with explicit universe levels.

We also fully discuss and emphasize that non-constructive classical axioms can be assumed consistently in univalent mathematics.

This is a literate Agda file, with the formal, verified, mathematical development within code environments, and the usual mathematical discussion outside them. Most of this file is not Agda code, and is in markdown format, and the HTML web page is generated automatically from it using Agda and other tools.
