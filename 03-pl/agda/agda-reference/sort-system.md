**Sorts** or **universes** are types whose members are themselves types.

The fundamental sort in Agda is named `Set` and it denotes *the universe of small types*.

However, for some applications, other sorts are needed. This page explains the need for additional sorts and describes all the sorts that are used by Agda.

## Introduction to universes

Russell's paradox implies that the collection of all sets is not itself a set.

Namely, if there were such a set `ùì§`, then one could form the subset `A ‚äÜ ùì§` of all sets that do not contain themselves. Then we'd have `A ‚àà A` iff `A ‚àâ A`, a contradiction.

Likewise, Martin-L√∂f's type theory originally had a rule `Set : Set` (aka type-in-type), but Girard showed that it is inconsistent, bringing about the *Girard's pradox*. Hence, not every Agda type is a `Set`. For example, `Bool : Set` and `Nat : Set`, but `Set` doesn't have the type `Set`, even though it may appear so. This is because `Set` types have a, sometimes implicit, subscript that denotes their level. It is convenient for `Set` to have a type of its own, and so in Agda, it is given the type `Set‚ÇÅ`, i.e. `Set : Set‚ÇÅ`, which is actually `Set‚ÇÄ : Set‚ÇÅ`.

In many ways, expressions of type `Set‚ÇÅ` behave just like expressions of type `Set`, e.g. they may be used as types of other things. However, the elements of `Set‚ÇÅ` are potentially larger: when `A : Set‚ÇÅ` then `A` is sometimes called a *large set*. In turn, we have `Set‚ÇÅ : Set‚ÇÇ` and `Set‚ÇÇ : Set‚ÇÉ` and so on.

A type whose elements are types is called a *sort* or a *universe*.

Agda provides an infinite number of universes: `Set`, `Set‚ÇÅ`, `Set‚ÇÇ`, etc. Each universe is an element of the next ones (of all the bigger ones, which breaks the fundamental type theoretical concept that each term has exactly one type).

`Set` itself is just an abbreviation for `Set‚ÇÄ` or `Set0`. 
The subscript `n` is called the *level of the universe* `Set‚Çô`.

## Universe example

Sometimes it is necessary to define, and prove theorems about, functions that operate not just on sets, but on large sets.

In fact, most Agda users sooner or later experience an error message where Agda complains that `Set‚ÇÅ != Set`. These errors usually mean that a small set was used where a large one was expected, or vice versa.

For example, suppose you have defined the usual datatypes for lists and the Cartesian product:

```hs
data List (A : Set) : Set where
  [] : List A
  _::_ : A ‚Üí List A ‚Üí List A

data _√ó_ (A B : Set) : Set where
 _,_ : A ‚Üí B ‚Üí A √ó B

infixr 5 _::_
infixr 4 _,_
infixr 2 _√ó_
```

Now suppose you'd like to define an operator `Prod` that takes a list of `n` sets and produces their Cartesian product:

```hs
Prod (A :: B :: C :: []) = A √ó B √ó C
```

the problem with this definition is that the type of `Prod` should be

```hs
Prod : List Set ‚Üí Set
```

However, the definition of `List A` specified that `A` is a `Set`. Therefore, `List Set` is not a valid type (then we'd have `Set : Set`). One (inferior) solution is to define a special version of the `List` operator that works for large sets:

```hs
data List‚ÇÅ (A : Set‚ÇÅ) : Set‚ÇÅ where
  []   : List‚ÇÅ A
  _::_ : A ‚Üí List‚ÇÅ A ‚Üí List‚ÇÅ A
```

With this, we can indeed define:

```hs
Prod : List‚ÇÅ Set ‚Üí Set
Prod []        = ‚ä§
Prod (A :: As) = A √ó Prod As
```

## Universe polymorphism

To allow definitions of functions and datatypes that work for all possible universes, `Set·µ¢`, Agda provides the type called `Level` that is the type of *universe levels*. With it, Agda supports *level-polymorphic universes*, `Set ‚Ñì`, where `‚Ñì : Level`.


See: [universe levels](./universe-levels.md)


## Agda's sort system

The implementation of Agda's sort system is closely based on the theory of *pure type systems*. The full sort system of Agda consists of the following sorts:
- `Set·µ¢`  and its universe-polymorphic variant `Set ‚Ñì`
- `Prop·µ¢` and its universe-polymorphic variant `Prop ‚Ñì`
- `Setœâ·µ¢`

## Sorts Set·µ¢ and Set ‚Ñì

Agda has a hierarchy of sorts `Set·µ¢ : Set·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ`, where `i` is any concrete natural number. The sort `Set` is an abbreviation for `Set‚ÇÄ`.

You can also refer to these sorts with the alternative syntax `Seti`, which means that you can also write `Set0`, `Set1`, ‚Ä¶, instead of `Set‚ÇÄ`, `Set‚ÇÅ`, `Set‚ÇÇ`, etc.

In addition, Agda supports the universe-polymorphic version `Set ‚Ñì` where `‚Ñì : Level` (see universe levels).

## Sorts Prop·µ¢ and Prop ‚Ñì

In addition to the hierarchy `Set·µ¢`, Agda also supports a second hierarchy `Prop·µ¢ : Set·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ` (or `Propi`) of **proof-irrelevant propositions**.

Like Set, `Prop` also has a universe-polymorphic version `Prop ‚Ñì` where `‚Ñì : Level`.

## Sorts Setœâ·µ¢

To assign a sort to types such as `(‚Ñì : Level) ‚Üí Set ‚Ñì`, Agda further supports an additional sort `Setœâ` that stands above all sorts `Set·µ¢`.

Just as for `Set` and `Prop`, `Setœâ` is the lowest level at an infinite hierarchy `Setœâ·µ¢ : Setœâ·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ` where `Setœâ` = `Setœâ‚ÇÄ`.

You can also refer to these sorts with the alternative syntax `Setœâi`. That means that you can also write Setœâ0, Setœâ1, Setœâ2, etc., instead of Setœâ‚ÇÄ, Setœâ‚ÇÅ, Setœâ‚ÇÇ.

It is allowed, for instance, to declare a datatype in `Setœâ`. This means that, before the implementation of this hierarchy, `Setœâ` used to be a term, and there was no bigger sort that it in Agda. Now a type can be assigned to it, in this case, `Setœâ‚ÇÅ`.

However, unlike the standard hierarchy of universes `Set·µ¢`, this second hierarchy `Setœâ·µ¢` does not support universe polymorphism. This means that it is not possible to quantify over all `Setœâ·µ¢` at once. For example, the expression `‚àÄ {i} (A : Setœâ i) ‚Üí A ‚Üí A` would not be a well-formed term (see the section on Setœâ on the page on universe levels).

Concerning other applications, It should not be necessary to refer to these sorts during normal usage of Agda, but they might be useful for defining *reflection-based macros*.

https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.2.2/language/reflection.html#macros

NOTE: When `--omega-in-omega` is enabled, `Setœâ·µ¢` is considered to be equal to `Setœâ` for all `i` (thus rendering Agda inconsistent).

## Sort metavariables and unknown sorts

Under universe polymorphism, levels can be arbitrary terms, e.g. a level that contains free variables. Sometimes, we will have to check that some expression has a valid type without knowing what sort it has. For this reason, Agda's internal representation of sorts implements a constructor (sort metavariable) representing an unknown sort. The constraint solver can compute these sort metavariables, just like it does when computing regular term metavariables.

However, the presence of sort metavariables also means that sorts of other types sometimes cannot be computed directly. For this reason, Agda's internal representation of sorts includes 3 additional constructors: `funSort`, `univSort`, and `piSort`. These constructors compute to the proper sort once enough metavariables in their arguments have been solved.

NOTE: `funSort`, `univSort` and `piSort` are internal constructors that may be printed when evaluating a term. The user can not enter them, nor introduce them in the code. These constructors don't represent new sorts but instead, they compute to the right sort once their arguments are known.

## funSort

The constructor `funSort` computes the sort of a function type even if the sort of the domain and the sort of the codomain are still unknown.

To understand how funSort works in general, let us assume the following scenario:
- sA and sB are two (possibly different) sorts.
- A : sA, meaning that A is a type that has sort sA.
- B : sB, meaning that B is a (possibly different) type that has sort sB.

Under these conditions, we can build the function type `A ‚Üí B : funSort sA sB`. This type signature means that the function type `A ‚Üí B` has a (possibly unknown) but well-defined sort `funSort sA sB`, specified in terms of the sorts of its domain and codomain.

If `sA` and `sB` happen to be known, then `funSort sA sB` can be computed to a sort value. We list below all the possible computations that `funSort` can perform:

```hs
funSort Setœâ·µ¢    Setœâ‚±º    = Setœâ‚Çñ            (where k = max(i,j))
funSort Setœâ·µ¢    (Set b)  = Setœâ·µ¢
funSort Setœâ·µ¢    (Prop b) = Setœâ·µ¢
funSort (Set a)  Setœâ‚±º    = Setœâ‚±º
funSort (Prop a) Setœâ‚±º    = Setœâ‚±º
funSort (Set a)  (Set b)  = Set (a ‚äî b)
funSort (Prop a) (Set b)  = Set (a ‚äî b)
funSort (Set a)  (Prop b) = Prop (a ‚äî b)
funSort (Prop a) (Prop b) = Prop (a ‚äî b)
```

Example: the sort of the function type `‚àÄ {A} ‚Üí A ‚Üí A` with normal form `{A : _5} ‚Üí A ‚Üí A` evaluates to `funSort (univSort _5) (funSort _5 _5)` where:
- `_5` is a metavariable that represents the sort of `A`
- `funSort _5 _5` is the sort of `A ‚Üí A`

Note: `funSort` can admit just two arguments, so it will be iterated when the function type has multiple arguments; e.g. the function type `‚àÄ {A} ‚Üí A ‚Üí A ‚Üí A` evaluates to `funSort (univSort _5) (funSort _5 (funSort _5 _5))`.

## univSort

univSort returns the successor sort of a given sort.

Example: the sort of the function type ‚àÄ {A} ‚Üí A with normal form {A : _5} ‚Üí A evaluates to funSort (univSort _5) _5 where:

univSort _5 is the sort where the sort of A lives, ie. the successor level of _5.

We list below all the possible computations that univSort can perform:

```hs
univSort (Set a)  = Set (lsuc a)
univSort (Prop a) = Set (lsuc a)
univSort Setœâ·µ¢    = Setœâ·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ
```

## piSort

Similarly, piSort s1 s2 is a constructor that computes the sort of a Œ†-type given the sort s1 of its domain and the sort s2 of its codomain as arguments.

To understand how piSort works in general, we set the following scenario:

sA and sB are two (possibly different) sorts.
A : sA, meaning that A is a type that has sort sA.
x : A, meaning that x has type A.
B : sB, meaning that B is a type (possibly different than A) that has sort sB.

Under these conditions, we can build the dependent function type (x : A) ‚Üí B : piSort sA (Œª x ‚Üí sB). This type signature means that the dependent function type (x : A) ‚Üí B has a (possibly unknown) but well-defined sort piSort sA sB, specified in terms of the element x : A and the sorts of its domain and codomain.

We list below all the possible computations that piSort can perform:

```hs
piSort s1       (Œª x ‚Üí s2) = funSort s1 s2  (if x does not occur freely in s2)
piSort (Set ‚Ñì)  (Œª x ‚Üí s2) = Setœâ           (if x occurs rigidly in s2)
piSort (Prop ‚Ñì) (Œª x ‚Üí s2) = Setœâ           (if x occurs rigidly in s2)
piSort Setœâ·µ¢    (Œª x ‚Üí s2) = Setœâ·µ¢          (if x occurs rigidly in s2)
```

With these rules, we can compute the sort of the function type ‚àÄ {A} ‚Üí ‚àÄ {B} ‚Üí B ‚Üí A ‚Üí B (or more explicitly, {A : _9} {B : _7} ‚Üí B ‚Üí A ‚Üí B) to be piSort (univSort _9) (Œª A ‚Üí funSort (univSort _7) (funSort _7 (funSort _9 _7)))

More examples:
- piSort Level (Œª l ‚Üí Set l) evaluates to Setœâ
- piSort (Set l) (Œª _ ‚Üí Set l') evaluates to Set (l ‚äî l')
- univSort (Set l) evaluates to Set (lsuc l)
- piSort s (Œª x -> Setœâi) evaluates to funSort s Setœâ
