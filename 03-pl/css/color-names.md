# CSS :: Color names

- color names are based on the *X11 color names*
- extended color keywords, X11 colors, or SVG colors.

* Color name literals:
  - `transparent`  keyword
  - `currentcolor` keyword
  - Standard color names (16 + 150)
    - 16 Elementary Color Names:
      - black   #000000
      - silver  #c0c0c0
      - gray    #808080
      - white   #ffffff
      - maroon  #800000
      - red     #ff0000
      - purple  #800080
      - fuchsia #ff00ff
      - green   #008000
      - lime    #00ff00
      - olive   #808000
      - yellow  #ffff00
      - navy    #000080
      - blue    #0000ff
      - teal    #008080

    - 150 Additional Color Names


- CSS Level 1: only 16 basic colors
- CSS Level 2: added 'orange'
- CSS Colors Level 3: standardization of X11 color names
- CSS Colors Level 4: added 'rebeccapurple' #663399

Web designers found this list too short, and browser vendors added numerous names for colors based on the *X11 color names*. In *SVG 1.0*, then in *CSS Colors Level 3*, these names got standardized, formally defined, and made uniform (some had different spellings that are now aliases). They are called **extended color keywords**, **X11 colors**, or **SVG colors**. In *CSS Colors Level 4*, an additional color, 'rebeccapurple' (#663399) was added to honor web pioneer Eric Meyer (https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/19/rebeccapurple/).
