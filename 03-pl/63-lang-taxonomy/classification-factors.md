List of classification factors
  - language generation
  - language family
  - language purpose
  - language level of abstraction
  - language paradigm
  - language type system
  - language domain


* Classification: by generation
  - 1st gen
  - 2nd gen
  - 3rd gen
  - 4th gen
  - 5th gen

* Classification: by level of abstraction
  - at the metal, 0 level
    - machine language
  - low-level, near-the-metal
    - assembly languages
  - high-level languages
  - higher-level languages

* Classification: by paradigm
  - imperative
    - procedural
    - OO
  - declarative
    - functional
    - logic
    - reactive

* Classification: by orientation
  - procedure-oriented
  - object-oriented
  - aspect-oriented

* Classification: by purpose
  - general purpose
  - scripting
  - query
  - modeling
  - presentation (HTML, CSS, markup)
  - markup languages
  - description languages
  - formal logic (FOL, SOL, HOL, set theory)
  - specification languages


* Classification: by domain
  - business application (DSL)
  - scientific application (data mining)
  - artificial intelligence (?)
  - systems programming (drivers, firmware, â€¦)
  - web platform (JS, Wasm, CCS, HTTP, HTML, XML, JSON)
  - glue languages (shell): bash, zsh, fish
  - academic (learning, investigation)
  - esoteric (pushing the limits, for shit n' giggles)

* Classification: by type system
  - statically-typed
    - dependently-typed
    - strongly-typed
    - weakly-typed
  - dynamically-typed
    - forgiving (JS)
    - unforgiving (?)


* Classification: by key properties
  - abstraction
  - structuring
  - readability
  - elegance
  - complexity
  - efficiency
  - portability
  - orthogonality
  - expressiveness
  - reliability
  - vulnerability
  - cost
  - error handling means
  - generality (general, non-specific)
  - well-definedness ?

* Classification: by features
  - structural features
    - procedures
    - functions
    - blocks
  - scoping rules
    - lexical
    - dynamic scoping
  - classes and objects (in the OO sense)
    - class
    - object
    - inheritance
  - mutability
  - generics
  - polymorphism
    - subtype polymorphism
    - parametric polymorphism
    - ad hoc polymorphism
  - reflection
  - metaprogramming
  - concurrency


* Classification: misc factors
  - compiled language
  - interpreted language
  - server-side language
  - client-side language
  - client-server architecture
  - hosted languages (JS, VB)
  - downloaded [?] (js, css, html)
  - DSL
  - embedded DSL (eDSL)
  - ideo [?] (lisp: data = code)
  - concurrent vs sequential vs parallel
  - distributed
  - pure vs impure
  - strict vs lazy
