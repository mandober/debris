# Prolog Wikibook

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Prolog/

This book can serve as a textbook or tutorial for anyone who wants to learn the Prolog programming language. No prior programming experience is required, but some knowledge of logic can come in handy.

The first chapters of the book, under *Basics*, describe the central syntax and features of the language. The next section, *Programming*, explores additional concepts that are useful when programming in Prolog. The section *Built-in Predicates* deals with the functions available in many Prolog compilers.
