# Prolog implementations

* Scryer Prolog
https://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog
A modern Prolog implementation written mostly in Rust. Scryer Prolog aims to become to ISO Prolog what GHC is to Haskell: an open source industrial strength production environment that is also a testbed for bleeding edge research in logic and constraint programming, which is itself written in a high-level language.

* SICStus Prolog
https://sicstus.sics.se/
A state-of-the-art, ISO standard compliant, Prolog system.

* Tau Prolog
https://github.com/tau-prolog/tau-prolog

* Trealla Prolog
http://tau-prolog.org/
https://github.com/infradig/trealla
A compact, efficient Prolog interpreter written in plain-old C.
An open source Prolog interpreter in JavaScript

* GNU Prolog
http://www.gprolog.org/
A free Prolog compiler with constraint solving over finite domains.

* SWI-Prolog
https://www.swi-prolog.org
https://github.com/SWI-Prolog

* Mercury
https://mercurylang.org/
Mercury is a functional logical programming language which combines the clarity and expressiveness of declarative programming with advanced static analysis and error detection features. Its highly optimized execution algorithm delivers efficiency far in excess of existing logic programming systems, and close to conventional programming systems. Mercury addresses the problems of large-scale program development, allowing modularity, separate compilation, and numerous optimization/time trade-offs.
