# Programming Languages

- collection: `tech` debrief
- collection-desc: notes about PL, Web platform, Apps, OSs, and some unorganized notes pertaining to several sciences (phylosophy, physics, etc.)
- section: `tech::pl`
- section-desc: notes and ref re some actual PLs


This subsection, `pl` (parent section: `tech`) holds notes, docs and reference pertaining to some actual programming languages. This section deals only with the practical aspects of programming languages - theoretical aspects of programming languages are described in the `cs` debrief - thereby it contains notes about actual (concrete) languages, not about the theoretical background (the how-tos, not the wtfs).

Where the theoretical notes describe the different PL paradigms, these notes describe some members of major programming paradigms. Usually, there is one language that best represents a paradigm - the canonical representative. So, each paradigm defines an equivalence class, and [lang_a] ≅ [lang_b] if `lang_a, lang_b ∈ {paradigm}`. Nevertheless, PL usually support a mix of paradigms. However, there is usually one paradigm that feels the most natural given a particular PL - it is exactly that paradigm according to which it is classified.

Major paradigms with their canonical and other representatives:
- procedural: C (canonical), JS, TS, Lua, Vimscript legacy, Vimscript 9
- object-orientated: C++, Java, C#, PHP
- functional: OCaml
- purely-functional: Haskell, Clean, PureScript
- logical: Prolog
- logical-functional: Mercury
- theorem provers: Agda, Idris, Lean, Coq
