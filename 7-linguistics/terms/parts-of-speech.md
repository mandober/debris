**Aspect** is a grammatical category that expresses how an action, event, or state, denoted by a verb, extends over time. *Perfective aspect* is used in referring to an event conceived as bounded and unitary, without reference to any flow of time during ("I helped him"). *Imperfective aspect* is used for situations conceived as existing continuously or repetitively as time flows ("I was helping him", "I used to help people").
