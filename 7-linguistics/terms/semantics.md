# Semantics

## Formal semantics

Formal semantics is an interdisciplinary field, a subfield of linguistics and philosophy, that studies the grammatical meaning in natural languages using formal tools from logic and theoretical CS. It is often thought of as reverse-engineering the semantic components of grammars of natural languages. Formal semantics provides accounts of what linguistic expressions mean and how their meanings are composed from the meanings of their parts (compositionality).
