In traditional grammar, a *part of speech* (PoS) is a category of words (or, more generally, of *lexical items*) that have similar grammatical properties.

Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar syntactic behavior (they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences), sometimes similar morphology in that they undergo *inflection* for similar properties and even similar semantic behavior.
