## Abecedarium
An abecedarium is a listing of all the letters of an alphabet listed in order.

## Abecedaria
Abecedaria are practice exercises related to an alphabet and the ordered sequence of letters of an alphabet.

## Acrophony
Acrophony (`ἄκρος` /akros/ uppermost + `φωνή` /phone/ sound) is the naming of letters of an alphabetic writing system so that a letter's name begins with the letter itself. For example, Greek letter names are acrophonic.

## Alphabet
An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that represent the phonemes (basic significant sounds) of any spoken language it is used to write.

The first fully phonemic script, the Proto-Canaanite script, later known as the Phoenician alphabet, is considered to be the first alphabet, and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets, including Arabic, Greek, Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and possibly Brahmic.

Of the dozens of alphabets in use today, the most popular is the Latin alphabet, which was derived from the Greek, and which many languages modify by adding letters formed using diacritical marks. While most alphabets have letters composed of lines (linear writing), there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in Braille. The *Khmer alphabet (for Cambodian) is the longest, with 74 letters*. Alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters. This makes them useful for purposes of collation, specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order. It also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of "numbering" ordered items, in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements.

## Annunciation
The act of announcing or of being announced.

## Character
A character is an individual sign or symbol, although its definition is left vague in the modern Unicode times. However, back in the ASCII world, the definition of a character wasn't so clear either: whether is represented only printable symbols, or printables plus whitespaces, or all of the 127 ASCII symbols including the control "characters". It was probably the last. The problem with Unicode is not so much whether printable or unprintable code points are counted as characters, but it has to do with multi-byte characters (letters) from misc languages. The concept of the length of a string can vary wildly.

## Compositionality
In semantics and mathematical logic, the principle of compositionality states that the meaning of an expression is determined by the meanings of the subexpressions, along with the rules of how to combine them. This principle is also called "Frege's principle", because Frege is widely credited for its first modern formulation, even though the principle was never explicitly stated by Frege, and it was arguably already assumed by Boole.

## Comprehension
A comprehension is a set of all intensions.

In logic, the *comprehension* of an object is the *totality of intensions*; it is the set of all its properties, qualities, attributes, characteristics, marks, etc. A term's comprehension contains the totality of intensions that are pertinent to the context of a given discussion. This is the correct terminology to reference the entirety of object's intensions, but informally the term "intension" is used to refer to both, a particular intension, as well to the comprehension.

## Connotation
A word's connotation includes associated meanings and pragmatic inferences. While the denotational meaning of a word is perceived through visible concepts, its connotational meaning evokes sensurround attitudes towards the phenomena. Connotation refers to the wide array of positive and negative associations that most words naturally carry with them, whereas denotation is the precise, literal meaning of the term (as found in a dictionary).

## Definition
A definition is two-part lingustic construction consisting of the definiendum ("that which is being defined") and the definiens ("that which defines (it)").

An example of a definition: "A definition is a construction where a new term is introduced by stating its meaning in terms of the other, previously defined, terms.

A definition is a formal, strict construction, and the definiens must cover all the aspects (edge and corner cases) concerning the definiendum. A description is a definition's loose sibling in which the term is not really defined but rather "loosely explained".

In HTML, the definiendum is wrapped with the "<dt>" (definition term) tag, and the definiens with the "<dd>" (definition description) tag, while both are nested inside the "<dl>" (definition list) tag.

```
                        <dl>
DEFINIENDUM 1             <dt>DEFINIENDUM 1</dt>
  definiens 1 …             <dd>definiens 1</dd>
DEFINIENDUM 2             <dt>DEFINIENDUM 2</dt>
  definiens 2 …             <dd>definiens 2</dd>
                        </dl>
```


## Denotation
In linguistics and philosophy, the denotation of an expression is its literal meaning. Denotation is contrasted with other aspects of meaning including connotation and pragmatic inferences. For example, the word "warm" **denotes** the property of being warm, but it may also evoke the feeling of calmness or coziness, which are subjective associations and as such they are extrinsic to the word's denotation (to the word's central meaning). Likewise, the denotation of a word is separate from the pragmatic inferences it may trigger. Describing something as warm often implies that it is not hot, but, again, this is not a part of the word's denotation.

## Diacritic
A diacritic is a glyph added to a letter or basic glyph.

## Entailment
Logical consequence, or entailment, is a fundamental concept in logic, which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when the conclusion logically follows from the propositions. A valid logical argument is the one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because it is the consequence of the premises. The philosophical analysis of logical consequence poses the questions "In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises?".

## Extension
An *extension* of a concept (idea, sign) consists of the things to which it applies, in contrast with its comprehension or intension, which (roughly) consists of the ideas, properties or corresponding signs that are implied or suggested by the concept in question.

In linguistics, logic, mathematics, semantics, semiotics and other fields that study the use of signs, the extension of a concept (object, idea, sign) consists of all the things to which it applies, in contrast with its intension (comprehension), which consists (roughly) of the ideas, properties and corresponding signs that are implied or suggested by the concept in question.

## Formal semantics
Formal semantics is an interdisciplinary field, a subfield of linguistics and philosophy, that studies the grammatical meaning in natural languages using formal tools from logic and theoretical CS. It is often thought of as reverse-engineering the semantic components of grammars of natural languages. Formal semantics provides accounts of what linguistic expressions mean and how their meanings are composed from the meanings of their parts (compositionality).

## Glyph
In typography, a glyph is an elementary symbol within an agreed set of symbols, intended to represent a readable character for the purposes of writing. Glyphs are considered to be unique markings that collectively add up to the spelling of a word, contribute to a specific meaning (dependent on cultural and social usage) of what is written, denote punctuations.

## Grapheme
Graphemes (or letters) are the basic written symbols of a language. A grapheme is the smallest unit of a writing system of any given language. An individual grapheme may carry meaning by itself and may correspond to a single phoneme of the spoken language. Graphemes include: alphabetic letters, typographic ligatures, Chinese characters, numerical digits, punctuation marks, other individual symbols. A grapheme can also be construed as a graphical sign that independently represents a portion of linguistic material.

## Intension
In fields that study signs (linguistics, logic, semantics, semiotics) - an **intension** is any property or quality *connoted* by a word (or a phrase, or a symbol). In the case of a word, its definition often implies an intension. For instance, the *intensions* of the word "plant" include properties such as "being composed of cellulose", "alive", "organism". A *comprehension* is a set of all such intensions.

## Lexicon
A lexicon is the *vocabulary* of a language or branch of knowledge (such as nautical or medical). In linguistics, a lexicon is a language's inventory of *lexemes*.

## Linguistics
Linguistics is the scientific study of language that encompasses the analysis of every aspect of language and the methods for studying and modelling them. The traditional areas of linguistic analysis include phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.

## Logographic writing system
In logographic writing system each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit.

## Logical consequence
see Entailment

## Proposition
In logic and linguistics, a proposition is the meaning of a declarative sentence. In philosophy, "meaning" is understood to be a non-linguistic entity which is shared by all sentences with the same meaning. Equivalently, a proposition is the non-linguistic bearer of truth or falsity which makes any sentence that expresses it either true or false.

## Phoneme
Phonemes are the basic significant sounds of a language. They are the analog of syllables in writing.

## Phonemic writing system
A letter is a segmental symbol of a phonemic writing system. The set of all letters forms the alphabet. Letters approximately correspond to phonemes in the spoken form of the language.

## Pictogram
A pictogram, also called a pictogramme, pictograph, or simply picto, and in computer usage an icon, is an ideogram that conveys its meaning through its pictorial resemblance to a physical object. Pictographs are often used in writing and graphic systems in which the characters are to a considerable extent pictorial in appearance. A pictogram may also be used in subjects such as leisure, tourism, and geography.

## Pronunciation
Pronunciation is the way in which a word or a language is spoken. This may refer to generally agreed-upon sequences of sounds used in speaking a given word or language in a specific dialect or simply the way a particular individual speaks a word or language.

## Reading
Reading a text can be expressed orally (out loud) or accomplished purely in the mind as an internal process (reading silently) although it takes a lot of practice to stop yourself from excessive subvocalization. Research has shown that people read in sense groups, which means, roughly, that we read a number of words together so that they make sense. Other forms of reading include skimming, scanning, browsing.

## Subvocalization
Subvocalization (or silent inner speech) is the internal speech typically made when reading; it provides the sound of the word as it is read even though it is not said out loud. This is a natural phenomena when reading, and it is deemed that it helps the mind access meanings to comprehend and remember what is read, potentially reducing cognitive load. However, it doesn't seem necessary since the meaning of some symbols is comprehended much faster with just a quick glance; e.g. signs such as "WC" or "EXIT". It seems the subvocalization can be avoided for short, monosyllabic words, and the subvocalization is completely circumvented with symbols: proloferation of emojis has made it possible to instantly comprehend the meaning of long sentences represented with just a few emoji symbols. 🍑 🍆 💦 With the time saved by not subvocalizing most words, you can read a lot faster.The reasearch has found that it's impossible to completely discontinue subvocalizing, but, with enough practice, you can stop yourself from excessive subvocalization.

## Symbol
A symbol is a representation (mark, sign, word, etc.) that indicates or signifies a concept (notion, object, relation, abstraction, etc.). Symbols allow people to go beyond their individual knowledge by creating links between concepts and experiences (ideas, objects). All forms of communication are realized through the use of symbols. Symbols convey ideas and beliefs taking many forms including sounds, words,gestures, ideas, images, objects. For example, a red octagon symbolizes the command to stop the vehicle, having the equivalent power as if the order to stop has been given by an official authority.

## Syllable
A syllable is a unit of organization for a sequence of speech sounds. It is typically made up of a syllable nucleus (typically a vowel) with optional initial and final margins (typically consonants). Syllables are often considered the phonological building blocks of words.

## Syllabary writing system
A syllabary is a type of writing system in which each character represents a syllable, instead of a letter, as in a phonemic writing system.

## Writing system
A writing system is a method of visually representing verbal communication. A writing system is a secondary means of expressing a language, with oral expression defining a language. Another form of expression is with gestures in a language for deaf. Writing systems require shared understanding between writers and readers of the meaning behind the sets of characters that make up a script.
