# Greek numerals

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals

* Greek letters were used as numerals
* Classical *Ionian system*:
  - first 9 letters: numerals (1-9): 1άʹ 2βʹ 3γʹ 4δʹ 5εʹ 6ϛʹ 7ζʹ 8ηʹ 9θʹ
  - next 9 letters: multiples of 10, 10-90
  - next 9 letters: multiples of 100, 100-900

For this purpose, in addition to the 24 letters (which by that time made up the standard alphabet), 3 obsolete letters were revived:
- digamma, `ϝ`, for 6
- koppa, `Ϙ`, for 90
- sampi, `Ͳ`, for 900

This system has remained in use in Greek up to the present day, although today it is only employed for limited purposes such as enumerating chapters in a book, similar to the way Roman numerals are used in English.

The 3 extra symbols are today written as `ϛ`, `ϟ`, `ϡ` respectively.

To mark a letter as a numeral sign, a small stroke called "_keraia_" (`ʹ`) is added to the right of it.
