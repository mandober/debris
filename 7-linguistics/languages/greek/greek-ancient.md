# Ancient Greek

Ancient Greek is written in its own alphabet, which is derived from the Phoenician alphabet. There are **24 letters**:

```
Α Β Γ Δ Ε Ζ Η Θ  Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ξ Ο Π Ρ Σ   Τ Υ Φ  Χ  Ψ  Ω
α β γ δ ε ζ η θ  ι κ λ μ ν ξ ο π ρ σ/ς τ υ φ  χ  ψ  ω
a b g d e z ē th i k l m n x o p r s   t u ph kh ps ō
```

Inscriptions of the classical period show that at that time Greek was written entirely in capital letters, with no spaces between the words.

Two punctuation marks are used in Greek texts which are not found in English: the colon, which consists of a dot raised above the line ( ·∙ ) and the Greek question-mark, which looks like the English semicolon ( ; ).

The iota subscript is a diacritic mark in the Greek alphabet shaped like a small vertical stroke or miniature iota ⟨ι⟩ placed below the letter. It can occur with the vowel letters eta ⟨η⟩, omega ⟨ω⟩, and alpha ⟨α⟩. It represents the former presence of an [i] offglide after the vowel, forming a so‐called "long diphthong". Such diphthongs (i.e., ηι, ωι, ᾱι) - phonologically distinct from the corresponding normal or "short" diphthongs (i.e., ει, οι, ᾰι ) - were a feature of ancient Greek in the pre-classical and classical eras.

There are Unicode codepoints for all Greek vowels with iota adscript (for example, U+1FBC ᾼ GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PROSGEGRAMMENI).

It is a convention in Ancient Greek texts that a capital letter is not written at the beginning of a sentence (except in some texts to indicate the beginning of direct speech). However, capital letters are used for the initial letter of names. Where a name starts with a rough breathing, as in Ἑρμῆς (Hermês) "Hermes", it is the initial vowel, not the breathing, which is made capital.

Another convention of writing Greek is that the sound ng [ŋ] in the consonant clusters /ng/, /nk/ and /nkʰ/ is written with a gamma: γγ, γκ, γχ (ng, nk, nkh), as in ἄγγελος (ángelos) "messenger", ἀνάγκη (anánkē) "necessity", τυγχάνει (tunkhánei) "it happens (to be)".

* The small letter Σ (S) ("sigma") is written ς (s) at the end of a word, otherwise σ (s), e.g. σοφός (sophós) "wise", ἐσμέν (esmén) "we are".

Rough and smooth breathing
- The rough breathing, `῾`,  written *over a vowel letter*, marks the sound /h/ at the beginning of a word (BOW), before the vowel
- Written over the letter `ρ` (r) indicates that /r/ sound is voiceless
- At BOW, the letters `υ` and `ρ` always have the rough breathing
- The smooth breathing `᾿` (known as *ψῑλὸν πνεῦμα* /psilon pneuma/ or *ψῑλή* /psili/ in Greek, spīritus lēnis in Latin) marks the absence of the /h/ sound. It is used on any word which starts with a vowel, e.g. `ἐγώ` (egṓ) "I".

* The letters ⟨ο⟩ and ⟨ω⟩, pronounced identically by this time, were called __o mikron__ ("small o") and __o mega__ ("big o") respectively.

* The letter ⟨ε⟩ was called __e psilon__ ("plain e") to distinguish it from the identically pronounced digraph ⟨αι⟩.

* Also ⟨υ⟩, which at this time was pronounced [y], was called __y psilon__ ("plain y") to distinguish it from the identically pronounced digraph ⟨οι⟩.
