## New letters

* The ligatures ⟨Љ⟩ and ⟨Њ⟩, together with ⟨Џ⟩, ⟨Ђ⟩ and ⟨Ћ⟩ were developed specially for the Serbian alphabet.

- `Љ = Л + Ь` design by Sava Mrkalj
- `Њ = Н + Ь` design by Sava Mrkalj
- `Џ` based on Gea from Romanian Cyrillic alphabet
- `Ћ` based on Djerv from Glagolitic alphabet, design by Vuk Karadžić
- `Ђ` based on Ћ, design by Lukijan Mušicki


* Karadžić based the letters ⟨Љ⟩ and ⟨Њ⟩ on a design by Sava Mrkalj, combining the letters ⟨Л⟩ and ⟨Н⟩ with the soft sign (Ь).

* Karadžić based ⟨Џ⟩ on letter "Gea" in the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet.

* ⟨Ћ⟩ was adopted by Karadžić to represent the voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate /tɕ/. The letter was based on, but different in appearance to, the letter Djerv (`Ⰼ`, `Ꙉ`), which is the 12th letter of the Glagolitic alphabet; that letter had been used in written Serbian since the 12th century, to represent /ɡʲ/, dʲ/ and /dʑ/.

* Karadžić adopted a design by Lukijan Mušicki for the letter ⟨Ђ⟩. It was based on the letter ⟨Ћ⟩, as adapted by Karadžić.

* ⟨Ј⟩ was adopted from the Latin alphabet.

* ⟨Љ⟩, ⟨Њ⟩ and ⟨Џ⟩ were later adopted for use in the Macedonian alphabet.
