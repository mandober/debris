**Early Earth** is loosely defined as Earth in its first one billion years, or 1 gigayear (Ga, 10⁹y). The "early Earth" encompasses approximately the first gigayear in the evolution of our planet, from its initial formation in the young Solar System at about 4.55 Ga to sometime in the Archean eon at about 3.5 Ga.
