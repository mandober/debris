## Rank names

The main ranks are:
  *kingdom* (regnum)
    *phylum* or *division* (divisio)
      *class* (classis)
        *order* (ordo)
          *family* (familia)
            *genus*
              *species*


The ranks of *section* and *series* are also used in `botany` for groups within *genera*. *Section* is used in `zoology` for a division of an order. 

Further levels in the hierarchy can be made by the addition of prefixes such as `sub-`, `super-`, `infra-`, etc.

Divisions such as "form", "variety", "strain", "breed", "cultivar", hybrid (nothospecies) and "landrace" are used to describe various *sub-specific groups* in different fields.

## All ranks

There is an indeterminate number of ranks, as a taxonomist may invent a new rank at will, at any time, if they feel this is necessary. In doing so, there are some restrictions, which will vary with the nomenclature code which applies. The following is an *artificial synthesis*, solely for purposes of demonstration of relative rank, from most general to most specific:
