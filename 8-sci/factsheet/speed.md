Increasing the number of neurons involved in a thought means a greater absolute distance the signal needs to travel - which necessarily means more time. Further, more neurons mean more connections. Most neurons are not in physical contact with other neurons. Instead, most signals are passed via neurotransmitter molecules that travel across the small spaces between the nerve cells called synapses. This process takes more time (*at least 0.5 ms per synapse*) than if the signal was continually passed within the single neuron.
