# Factsheet


Earth's habitable epoch started when the universe was 10-17 million years old

* 1 yr = 12 mths = 52 weeks = 365 days = 8,760 hrs = 525,600 min = 31,536,000 s
* 1 Kyr = 1,000 years = 31,536,000,000 s = 0.31536e11
  - K, kilo = 1,000 = 10^3 = 1+e3
* 1 Myr = 1,000,000 years
  - 1,000,000 = 10^6 = 1e6 = 1 million
* 1 Gyr = 1,000,000,000 years, aka 1*aeon*
  - 1,000,000,000 = 10^9 = 1e9 =
    - 1 *billion* (bn) @short scale
    - 1 *milliard* @long scale


## Mass

* Atom
  - mass of proton:       1.6726e-27 kg
  - mass of electron: 9.10938356E-31 kg
  - (-27 > -31). therefore the proton is roughly 4 orders of magnitude (10,000 times) more massive than the electron
- Earth's mass: 5.9724e24 kg
- The Earth's circumference is approximately 4e7 m


## Relativity

**Doppler effect**: car moving towards you sounds high pitched cuz sound waves are short, compressed. as it passes you sound waves gets more stretched having lower and lower pitch. Same with light, blue is short wave, red is longer, stretched wave. For infinite number of observers moving at the different speed, all these realities exist at the same time. One observer only sees one, his own, reality, all others realities exists, but they're unrealized for him. The set of all observers each experiencing his reality, amount to that many realites.


## Earth

- Age of Earth: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Age_of_the_Earth
- Earth's habitable epoch happend when the age of the universe was 10-17 million years.

- 4.54 billion years ago: birth of the Earth
- 3.5 billion years ago: the earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth
- 2.4 billion years ago: Great Oxygenation Event
- 440 million years ago: End of the Ordovician:
  86% of all species lost, including graptolites
- 375 million years ago: Late Devonian
  75% of species lost, including most trilobites
- 251 million years ago: End of the Permian, "The Great Dying"
  96% of species lost, including tabulate corals, most extant trees, synapsids
- 200 million years ago: End of the Triassic
  80% of species lost, including all of the conodonts
- 66 million years ago: End of the Cretaceous
  76% of species lost, including all of the ammonites, mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and nonavian dinosaurs

_Eons_
- Hadean:      4000 Ma - earlier
- Archean:     4000 Ma - 2500 Ma
- Proterozoic: 2500 Ma - 542 Ma
- Phanerozoic:  542 Ma - present

Proterozoic eras:
- Palaeoproterozoic
- Mesoproterozoic
- Neoproterozoic

Phanerozoic eon contains 3 _eras_ divided by major mass extinctions:
- Paleozoic:    542 Ma - 251.0 Ma
- Mesozoic:   251.4 Ma - 66 Ma
- Cenozoic:      66 Ma - present

Paleozoic _periods_:
- Cambrian
- Ordovician
- Silurian
- Devonian
- Carboniferous
- Permian

Mesozoic periods:
  - Triassic
  - Jurassic
  - Cretaceous

- 6.5 Ma First hominins
- 1.2 Ma Evolution of Homo antecessor
- 600 ka Evolution of Homo heidelbergensis
- 350 ka Evolution of Neanderthals
- 250 ka Anatomically modern humans appear in Africa.
  - Around 50,000 years ago they start colonising the other continents, replacing the Neanderthals in Europe and other hominins in Asia.
- 30 ka Extinction of Neanderthals



## Life

- Scientific evidence suggests that life began on Earth at least 3.5 billion years ago.
- The earliest evidence for life on Earth is graphite found to be biogenic in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland.
- Also microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia.
- More recently, in 2015, "remains of biotic life" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.

More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.

Earth's current species estimate: 10-14 million
- of which about 1.2 million have been documented 
- over 86 percent have not yet been described.
- However, a May 2016 scientific report estimates that 1 trillion species are currently on Earth, with only one-thousandth of one percent described.


## Animals

- Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described
- of which around 1 million are insects
- estimate: over 7 million animal species in total.
- Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres
- Cambrian explosion began ~542 million years ago.
- 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified
- these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.


## Humans

- Human body is colonized by tremendous amount of microorganisms.
- Human *microbiota* (reference: male, 70kg, 170cm):
  - 37.2 trillion human cells
  - 100 trillion bacterial cells
- Ratio of non-human to human cells
  - traditional estimate, which turned out incorrect: 10:1
  - modern estimate: 3:1 (even 1:1 by some sources)
- **Gastric acid** is one of the main secretions of the stomach, consisting mainly of *hydrochloric acid*.

## Bandwidth of ejaculate

Male ejaculates about 300 million sperm cells within 5 seconds. The DNA in each cell consists of 3 billion base pairs, each storing 2 bits of information. This means that a human ejaculation has a bandwidth of about 40.000 terabytes/sec.


## First website

The first website ever was created by the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee. He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989, and he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet in November 1989.
