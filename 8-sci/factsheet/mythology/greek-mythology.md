## Greek pantheon

The Greek pantheon can be divided into 3 distinct generations:
1. Protogenoi
2. Titans
3. Olympians

### The Protogenoi

According to Hesiod and Homeric tradition, the first deities of the Greek pantheon were the Protogenoi, or the primordial gods.

Chaos was the first goddess (that always was). 3 other Protogenoi, the firstborns, came right after: Gaia, Tartarus, Eros.

The firstborns spawned next 7 Protogenoi (approx. this order although the Orphic tradition differs in the names and the order of these primordial gods): Nyx (Night), Erebus (Darkness), Ouranos (Sky), Pontus (Sea), Ourea (Mountains), Hemera (Day), Aether (Light).

### The Titans

Uranus and Gaia had 3 litters. The first litter gave 3 monsters which Uranus 

C litter of the 12 Titans:

Next came the Ouranos x Gaia C litter of the 12 Titans:

6 Titans
1. *Cronus*
2. *Iapetus*
3. *Oceanus*
4. *Hyperion*
5. *Crius*
6. *Coeus*

6 Titanides
1. *Rhea*
2. *Themis*
3. *Tethys*
4. *Theia*
5. *Mnemosyne*
6. *Phoebe*

Gaia would incite the Titans to rise up against their father, and Cronus would ultimately take up a sickle to castrate Ouranos, and destroy much of the god's powers.

Cronus would take up the position of supreme deity, and the rule of the Titans would then become known as the Golden Age of Greek mythology.

### The Olympians

The Golden Age of the Titans would ultimately come to an end in a similar way to the rule of Ouranos, for Gaia incited Zeus to rise up against his father, Cronus. The children of Cronus and Rhea had been imprisoned in the stomach of Cronus, although Zeus escaped this fate. 

When of age Zeus would release his siblings, and begin to launch a war against the Titans from Mount Olympus. A ten year war, the Titanomachy would follow, a war which ultimately Zeus and his siblings won.

The division of the cosmos then saw Zeus given dominion over the heavens and earth, Poseidon was given the sea, and Hades the Underworld.

Zeus would rule from Mount Olympus and the god was joined by 11 other Greek gods and goddesses; Poseidon, Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Aphrodite, Hermes, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Athena, and Hephaestus.

=============================================================================

## The Creation

In the beginning, there were neither light nor dark, places nor things, up nor down. There was nothing. This nothingness was called *Chaos*.

The first thing to grow out of Chaos was *Night*. Next to emerge was *Erebus*, the bottomless place where *Death* lives. Then night laid a silver egg, out of which hatched *Eros*.

*Gaia*, the mother earth, and *Uranus*, the father heaven, came into this universe of light and dark, life and death. Rain fell from heaven and lakes, oceans, and rivers were made, and green plants began to spring out of the earth.

Uranus and Gaia first produced the triplets of *monsters*, each with 50 heads and 100 hands (BONUS ROUND: What's the average number of leg root hands divided by the median number of fingers heads squared, among the 3 children, if one of them lost a head, a pinky, an arm and a leg?). Uranus immediately shut them up inside the earth. The *Cyclopes* triplets came next; each had one eye in the middle of the forehead. They were improved but Uranus shut them away, deeming them ugly and dangerous.

Third litter's the charm! The 12 *Titans*, six sons and six daughters, were the last of the devil's spawn. Big and strong as they were, the Titans were still afraid of youranus. Gaia planted the idea of "retiring" their evil father, thus a plot was undecisively plotted. Finally, *Cronus*, the youngest Titan, came up with the plan swiftly cut you're anus balls with a Gaia-issued sickle. He stick 'im up he did, wounding him badly. Uranus was in too much pain to fight back, all he could do was flee. As he fled upwards, he shouted down to Uranus: "One of your children will do the same to you!". Since the exile of Uranus, the sky never come near the earth again. From Uranus' blood that fell on back on the earth, spawned the *Giants* and the *Erinyes (Furies)*. These terrible creatures had live snakes for hair.

Cronus gave Gaia hard time, as he took his father's place as a ruthless ruler, making his Titan brothers his generals. To *Oceanus*, he gave the rule of the rivers and oceans that circled the world. To *Hyperion*, he gave the control of light; the children of Hyperion, the Sun, the Moon, and the Dawn, rode across the sky in their chariots once a day. The Titans became known as the **Elder Gods**.

## The War in Heaven

Cronus never forgot Uranus' warning, so he swallowed his first 5 children right off the bat. *Hestia*, *Demeter*, *Hera*, *Hades* and *Poseidon* were all chugged down by the time the sixth child, *Zeus*, was breaching.

Gaia's daughter *Rhea* married Chronus unbeknownst of his dietary habits. Oh, boy, was she upset! She ran to consult her mom Gaia about putting a stop to Chronus' diet. Gaia, having suffered similarly by Uruanus, advised her to go to the Island of Crete and hide the newborn (Zeus) in a secret cave on Mount Ida. She was then to serve a stone with diapers saus on the side to Uranus instead of the ùòñùò¶ùò∂ùòßùò¥ ùò•'ùò°ùò¶ùò∂ùò¥ ùò¢ùò∂ ùò∑ùò™ùòØ. Gaia reassured her daughter that her huseband, the cretin that he is, wouldn't know the difference. And so it went down. Chronus, the cretin that he is, swallowed the stone, lock, stock and barrel, suspecting nothing.

And so Zeus grew up on Crete, nursed by nymphs and shepherds, until Rhea sent the messenger Metis to visit Zeus and to show him how to brew a strong poison from herbs. The messenger told Zeus to go to Cronus's palace and hide there until he could get a chance to put the poison into Cronus's wine cup. Zeus did this, and one night, while he was hiding under the super table, he got his chance. Cronus had eaten a big meal and was sitting, drowsing, over his wine. Zeus slipped the poison into the cup.

As soon as Cronus had drunk the poisoned wine, an amazing thing happened. He got so sick that up came his first five children as well as the big stone wrapped in blankets.

Cronus had a strong stomach, though, and the poison only made him sick for a while. Although Zeus and his brothers, Hades and Poseidon quickly tied their father to his chair, he was soon shouting for his brother Titans. And thus began a battle that lasted for years. The Elder Gods were led by the Titan Atlas, and the Younger Gods were led by Zeus. First the Titans chased the Younger Gods up Mount Olympus, and it looked as if the Elder Gods were winning. So, Zeus decided to see his grandmother, Gaia.

Gaia was old, and she was getting impatient and more than a little irritated with the quarrels of her family. She was still upset that her husband Uranus had shut their first six children in the earth. So Gaia said to Zeus, "You have freed your mother's firstborn children, but until you free mine, you will not be victorious."

Zeus did not understand Gaia's words, for he knew little of his family history. So he shrugged his shoulders and went back to the battle.

The battle between the Titans and the Younger Gods might have raged even longer had it not been for Prometheus, a son of Iapetus, one of the Titans. For Prometheus could see into the future, and he knew that the reign of Cronus and the Titans was ending. He thought it would be best to settle things with the least possible damage, so he asked the Titans to make a truce.

Prometheus went to Zeus and told him about the monstrous children of Gaia and Uranus. He said to Zeus, "If you release them, they will fight on your side." Zeus went to the Underworld and freed the monsters and the Cyclopes. The monsters fought against the Titans with all their strength, and the Cyclopes made armor and weapons for Zeus and his brother. They made a helmet for Hades which made him invisible, a three-pronged spear for Poseidon, and thunderbolts for Zeus.

The Younger Gods now quickly won the war. Some of the Titans were flung into the underworld, some escaped and disappeared forever, and Atlas was made to stand at the western edge of the world, holding up the heavens. Only Prometheus and one or two of the Titan women were saved. Perhaps Prometheus was saved because of the help he had given to Zeus and the Younger Gods.

After the war was over, Zeus said that he would be the head of gods and men because he had done the most to overthrow the Titans and lead the Younger Gods to victory. But he divided the rule of the kingdom with Poseidon and Hades. Zeus ruled the heavens, Poseidon controlled the ocean, and Hades took charge of the world of the dead, or underworld. All the gods and goddesses and their children settled themselves on Mount Olympus, their new home.


## Prometheus creates men

Now that the war between the Titans and the Olympians was over, the time was right for a new race of men to be created. Since the twelve Olympian gods and goddesses were busy ruling, playing, and quarrelling among themselves, the gods assigned this task to Prometheus and Epimetheus, the sons of the Titan, Iapetus.

Prometheus had sided with the Olympians in their battle with the Titans, perhaps because he could see into the future and knew that they would win. His name means "fore-thought." Epimetheus was nothing like his brother. His name meant "after-thought," and he was always changing his mind about things.

Epimetheus was scatter-brained and impulsive. He wanted to do well at his share of the task of creating men, but, true to his name, he did not see the mistakes he was making until he had already made them. First he made the birds, then the fish, and then the animals. He fashioned each creature as carefully as if it were the only one. To each he gave the gift of some fine quality which would set it apart from all the rest. He gave cunning to the fox, swiftness to the antelope, wings to the eagle, a hard shell to the turtle, and so on. When he had finished with all the creatures, he turned to the task he had saved till the very end, that of making man. He first thought of giving man a warm, furry hide, but he had already given that to the bear. Then he thought of giving man fierce claws, but they had been given to the tiger. Sharp horns, a leathery skin, eyes that can see in the dark - Epimetheus tried desperately to remember some quality that he could give to man, whom he had thought to make the best of his creations, but there was nothing left to give.

He realized his mistake and begged Prometheus to help him. "Prometheus," he cried, "What can I do?"

"It's too bad you didn't think about this when you began," said Prometheus. "But if man is going to be soft, weak, naked, and slow, the least I can do is see that he is not stupid." So saying, Prometheus took a bit of clay and shaped it into a small likeness of the noble gods. He stood man upright, so that he might always look up to the heavens. Then he breathed life into the clay and gave man a superior mind with which he could reason, plan, remember, and dream. In this way, Prometheus set man above all the other creatures.

## Prometheus gives fire to men

The great flood that ended the Silver Age not only destroyed the men of that time, it also shook loose all the ice and snow which had been struck up in the northern part of the world. The climate of the earth was no longer mild, and the new men Prometheus had made suffered greatly from the cold. They spent a lot of time complaining about the bad weather and said that it was a cruel joke.

Prometheus knew that if Zeus would soon hear the complain of men, he would decide to drown these men, unless something was done. The best thing Prometheus could think of to make men's lives better was the gift of fire. With fire, man could warm himself, cook his food, and forge metal for tools and weapons. He could make lights at night, so that the world would not seem such a dark, dreary place. Prometheus also knew that Zeus would never agree to this, so he made his plans secretly.

He gave a last look at Olympus, for he knew he could never never return, and he told Athens good-bye. She had been his best friend there. Without another backward glance, Prometheus set out for the fiery home of the sun. He broke from the sun a fragment of glowing coal and, hiding it in the hollow of a giant fennel-stalk, he carried it down to earth. There he lit a central fire and showed men how to make it for themselves by rubbing sticks together.

Sitting around their evening fires, eating roast ox or lamb, men said to each other that they didn't know how they had survived before, without this fine thing called fire.


## Prometheus punished

When Zeus heard that Prometheus had given fire to man, he was terribly angry. He didn't really care whether men had fire or not, but the fact that Prometheus had aided man without his permission made him furious. It was the principle of the thing that Zeus has to make an example of Prometheus.

He ordered Prometheus to be seized and chained to the face of a great cliff in the Caucasian Mountains. A giant vulture was sent to eat at Prometheus's liver all day long. Each day his liver grew back, and there was no end to his suffering.

Zeus was a great schemer. He wanted revenge on Prometheus, but he also had an idea of how to make use of him. After a while, he sent Hermes to Prometheus with an offer.

Hermes told Prometheus that Zeus saw no reason to continue the punishment if Prometheus would make a reasonable agreement. Since Prometheus could see into the future, he would be able to tell Zeus the identity of the mother of the child destined to overthrow him.

Prometheus answered that he had already done more favors for Zeus than Zeus had ever done for him, and that he would not submit to blackmail. "I am in the right," said Prometheus. "I would rather suffer than give in to an unreasonable tyrant."
This answer made Zeus wild with anger, but he could do nothing more than rave.


## Pandora's Box

Of course Zeus was unreasonable when angry, but he didn't care. He was powerful and didn't want anyone to doubt it. From Prometheus, Zeus turned his anger upon mankind. Men were far too comfortable, so far as he was concerned.

Zeus thought of a clever plot to punish them for their disobedience, and he chuckled at his own cleverness. He would send a creation of his own to live among Prometheus's men. Zeus ordered Hephaestus to design a beautiful creature, a woman.

"She is lovely," said all the gods and goddesses when they saw her. "Let us help." Hestia gave the woman gentleness, Hermes made her light-footed, Aphrodite made her lovable, Apollo gave her a musical nature. They named her Pandora or "all-gifted."

"Perfect," said Zeus, still chuckling. Then he sent Pandora as a gift to Prometheus's slow-witted brother Epimetheus. Epimetheus had been warned not to accept presents from Zeus, but when he saw Pandora he forgot the warning entirely and married her on the spot. For a short time they live happily.

In Epimetheus's house there was a box left from the time when he and Prometheus had created the first creatures. They had used all the good things, but the evils were still stored in the box. Prometheus warned Epimetheus to guard the box and not to open it.

Epimetheus said, "Oh, I will." But he forgot all about it, leaving the box to stand, gathering dust in an unused attic.

When Epimetheus was at home, Pandora made him happy by singing sweet songs, arranging the cushions in his chair to make him comfortable, and bringing him good tidbits in golden platters. But as soon as Epimetheus left the house, Pandora was off poking into cupboards, reading old letters, and prying into things, instead of attending to her household work.

One day when Epimetheus was gone, Pandora found the box. It was tied round and round with ropes and padlocked shut with a thick chain. Because of great curiosity, Pandora ran and got a knife from the kitchen. One by one she cut through the ropes on the box and let them fall. Then she took Epimetheus's ring of keys from the closet.He had many keys, and she tried nearly a hundred before one turned in the lock.

For a long time Pandora just there, looking at the dusty box. She had a strong feeling she should leave it alone. But what might it contain? A present for her? Jewels? Or pehaps something Epimetheus was ashamed of?

She lifted the lid just a crack, thinking to take a quick peek and shut it again. Instantly all sorts of evil things rushed out and flew into the world: old age, sickness, envy, revenge, worry, pain, greed, hate, and everything else that you can think of. These things have been loose in the world ever since, and man has never been completely happy. But Prometheus had foreseen the day when someone might unloose these evils, and he had out into the box one good thing - hope.
