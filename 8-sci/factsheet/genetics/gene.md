# Gene

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene

* A gene is a region of DNA that encodes function.
* A gene is a basic unit of *heredity* and a sequence of *nucleotides* in DNA that encodes the synthesis of a *gene product*, which is either RNA or protein.

* The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of *phenotypic traits*. These genes make up different DNA sequences called *genotypes*. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the *phenotypes* will be.

* A *chromosome* consists of a long strand of DNA containing many genes. A *human chromosome* can have up to 500 million base pairs of DNA with thousands of genes.

* Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene-environment interactions.

* George Gamow postulated that sets of 3 bases must be employed to encode the 20 standard amino acids used by living cells to build proteins, which would allow a maximum of 4Â³ = 64 amino acids.

* Humans have roughly 20,000 genes all together. 
* A single strand of DNA contains thousands of genes or unique protein recipes.
* Some genes are small, only about 300 hundred letters long, others are well over a 1,000,000.
