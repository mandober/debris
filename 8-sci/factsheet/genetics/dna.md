# DNA

* Deoxyribonucleic acid is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix.

* DNA carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses.

* 4 major types of macromolecules essential for all known life forms: proteins, lipids, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), polysaccharides (complex carbohydrates).

* DNA is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides, each of which is usually symbolized by a single letter: either A, T, C, G

* The 2 DNA strands are called polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides.
* Each nucleotide is composed of one of 4 nitrogen-containing nucleobases: cytosine `C`, guanine `G`; adenine `A`, thymine `T`; a sugar called deoxyribose; and a phosphate group.
* nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone.
* The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T, C with G) with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA.
* In DNA, thymine and cytosine are pyrimidines; purines are adenine and guanine.

* A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.
* Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information.
* Gentic info is replicated as and when the two DNA strands separate (miosis).
* The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other (antiparallel)

* Attached to each sugar is one of 4 types of nucleobases (or bases). It is the sequence of these 4 nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic info.
* RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called *transcription*, where DNA bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine (T), for which RNA substitutes uracil (U).
* Under the genetic code, these RNA strands specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called *translation*.

* Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called *chromosomes*. Before typical cell division, these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of *DNA replication*, providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell.
* Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus as nuclear DNA, and some in the mitochondria as mitochondrial DNA or in chloroplasts as chloroplast DNA.
* In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm, in circular chromosomes.
* Within eukaryotic chromosomes, *chromatin proteins*, such as *histones*, compact and organize DNA. These compacting structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.


* In all species, DNA is composed of 2 helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled around the same axis, and have the same pitch of 34 ångströms (3.4 nm). The pair of chains have a radius of 10 Å (1.0 nm). In another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured 22-26 Å (2.2-2.6 nm) wide, and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3 Å (0.33 nm) long.

Although each individual nucleotide is very small, a DNA polymer can be very large and may contain hundreds of millions of nucleotides, such as in chromosome 1. Chromosome 1 is the largest human chromosome with approximately 220 million base pairs, and would be 85 mm long if straightened.

The orientation of the 3′ and 5′ carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone confers directionality (sometimes called polarity) to each DNA strand. In a nucleic acid double helix, the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime end (5′ ), and three prime end (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group.

One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.

The DNA double helix is stabilized primarily by two forces: hydrogen bonds between nucleotides and base-stacking interactions among aromatic nucleobases. 

The 4 bases found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). These 4 bases are attached to the sugar-phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for adenosine monophosphate. Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine, forming A-T and G-C base pairs.
