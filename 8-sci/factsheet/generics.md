# Genetics in numbers

- double-helix means 2 chains (strands) that run in opposite direction
- but are otherwise identical; there is always a copy on the other side
- so base pairs are unimportant for coding - what's important is what comes
  before and after the current base, not its pair on the other strand.
- for coding, either one strand of DNA is sufficient
- 46 chromosomes (23 pairs)
- eukaryotic somatic cells have 46 chromosomes (in the nucleaus)
- eukaryotic sex cells have 23 chromosomes
- each chromosome is a separate DNA molecule
- human chromosome has 500.000.000 base pairs with 1000's of genes
- 98% of human DNA is non-coding
- 96% of DNA is shared between humans and chips
- 50% of DNA is shared between humans and fruitflies
- a strand circles the axis once every 10.4 base pairs (@ chillin' DNA state)
- about 20 amino acids combine in diff ways to make what? proteins!
- A DNA polymer can be large; may contain hundreds of millions of nucleotides
- Chromosome 1 is the largest human chromosome with approximately 220 million base pairs; it would be 85 mm (3.3 inch) long if straightened.
- human genome contains roughly 20,000 genes
- human genome contains 3 billion base pairs
- A single strand of DNA contains thousands of genes or unique protein recipes.
- Some genes are small, only about 300 hundred letters long, others are well over a 1,000,000.
- every person has about 70 unique point mutations (point is a single base pair)
- 1g of DNA can hold 700 TB of data
- humans have total of 50g of DNA
- mitochondria has its own DNA originating from the mother (tracing maternal lines)

- 1000 pm (pico)  = 1 nm
- 1000 nm (nano)  = 1 μm
- 1000 μm (micro) = 1 mm
