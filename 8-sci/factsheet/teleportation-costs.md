# Beam me up, Scotty

In August 2008, physicist Michio Kaku predicted in Discovery Channel Magazine that a teleportation device similar to those in Star Trek would be invented within 100 years.

Physics students at University of Leicester calculated that to "beam up" just the genetic information of a *single human cell*, not the positions of the atoms, just the gene sequences, together with a "brain state" would take *4,850 trillion years*, assuming a 30 GHz microwave bandwidth.

A study by Eric Davis for the US Air Force Research Laboratory of speculative teleportation technologies showed that to dematerialize a human body by heating it up to a million times the temperature of the core of the sun, so that the quarks lose their binding energy and become massless and can be beamed at the speed of light (in the closest physics equivalent to the Star Trek teleportation scenario) would require the equivalent of *330 megatons of energy*.

To meet the information storage and transmission requirements would require current computing capabilities to continue to improve by a factor of 10-100 times per decade for 200-300 years.
