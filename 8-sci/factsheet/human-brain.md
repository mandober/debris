# Human brain

Human brain estimates:
- brain's internal clock:                 200 Hz
- the speed of axons:                     100 m/s
- neurons:                                10¹¹
- synaptic connections  per neuron:       up to 10⁴
- synapses:                               10¹⁵
- power use:                              23.2 W (2400 cal/day diet)
- energy:                                 2400 cal
- reaction time:                          250 ms
- percent of body's weight:               2%  (of body's weight)
- energy consumption:                     20% (of body's energy)


The human brain has an estimated *100 billion neurons* each with up *10,000 synaptic connections*, for a *total of approx. 1 quadrillion synapses*, yet operates on less power than a lightbulb, 23.2 W.

- power usage: 23.2 W (based on a 2400 calorie per day diet)
- the speed of axons: 100 m/s
- neurons: 100 billion = 100 000 000 000 = 10¹¹
- synaptic connections per neuron: up to 10 000     = 10⁴
- synapses: 1 quadrillion = 1 000 000 000 000 000   = 10¹⁵

The average *reaction time* of a human is ~ 0.25 s = 250 ms, meaning it takes about a quarter of a second after you see something to physically react to it.

The sprinter starting to run after the pistol bang: ~ 150 ms

In the human context, the signals carried by the large-diameter, myelinated neurons that link the spinal cord to the muscles can travel at speeds ranging 70-120 m/s. The signals traveling along the same paths carried by the small-diameter, unmyelinated fibers of the pain receptors travel at speeds ranging 0.5 - 2 m/s.



The brain makes up 2% of a person's weight. Despite this, even at rest, the brain consumes 20% of the body's energy. The brain consumes energy at 10 times the rate of the rest of the body per gram of tissue. The average power consumption of a typical adult is 100 Watts and the brain consumes 20% of this making the power of the brain 20 W.

Diet of 2400 calorie = 2400 kcal
2400 kcal/24 h = 100 kcal/h = 27.8 cal/s = 116.38 J/s = 116 W
20% of 116 W = 0.2*116 = 23.2 W


## Neural networks: number of synapses

- Human brain: ~8e14 synapses (800 trillion)
- IBM's TrueNorth chip: ~16e9 (16 billion) using 64 by 4,096 cores
- Intel's Loihi chip: ~30 million synapses

| Neural network | sn   |  number of synapses | same as      |
|----------------|------|--------------------:|--------------|
| Human brain    | 8e14 | 800 000 000 000 000 | human brain  |
| IBM TrueNorth  | 16e9 |      16 000 000 000 |              |
| Intel Loihi    | 13e7 |         130 000 000 | mole's brain |

The first iteration of the Loihi chip, made in 14 nm fabrication process, houses 128 clusters, each with 1,024 artificial neurons, for a total of 131,072 simulated neurons.


## The speed of thought
https://earthsky.org/human-world/what-is-the-speed-of-thought/

Increasing the number of neurons involved in a thought means a greater absolute distance the signal needs to travel - which necessarily means more time. Further, more neurons mean more connections. Most neurons are not in physical contact with other neurons. Instead, most signals are passed via neurotransmitter molecules that travel across the small spaces between the nerve cells called synapses. This process takes more time (*at least 0.5 ms per synapse*) than if the signal was continually passed within the single neuron.


It's amazing to consider that a given thought can be generated and acted on in less than 150 ms. Consider the sprinter at a starting line. The reception and perception of the crack of the starter gun, the decision to begin running, issuing of the movement commands, and generating muscle force to start running involves a network that begins in the inner ear and travels through numerous structures of the nervous system before reaching the muscles of the legs. All that can happen in literally half the time of a blink of an eye.

Although the time to initiate a sprint start is extremely short, a variety of factors can influence it. One is the loudness of the auditory "go" signal. Although reaction time tends to decrease as the loudness of the "go" increases, there appears to be a critical point in the range of 120-124 decibels where an additional decrease of approximately 18 ms can occur. That's because sounds this loud can generate the "startle" response and trigger a pre-planned sprinting response.

Researchers think this triggered response emerges through activation of neural centers in the brain stem. These startle-elicited responses may be quicker because they involve a relatively shorter and less complex neural system - one that does not necessarily require the signal to travel all the way up to the more complex structures of the cerebral cortex. A debate could be had here as to whether or not these triggered responses are "thoughts," because it can be questioned whether or not a true decision to act was made; but the reaction time differences of these responses illustrate the effect of neural factors such as distance and complexity.

Although we're aware of our thoughts and the resulting movements, an interesting *dissociation has been observed between the time we think we initiate a movement and when that movement actually starts*. In studies, researchers ask volunteers to watch a second hand rotate around a clock face and to complete a simple rapid finger or wrist movement, such as a key press, whenever they liked. After the clock hand had completed its rotation, the people were asked to identify where the hand was on the clock face when they started their own movement.
Surprisingly, *people typically judge the onset of their movement to occur 75-100 ms prior to when it actually began*. This difference cannot be accounted for simply by the time it takes for the movement *commands to travel from the brain to the arm muscles (which is on the order of 16-25 ms)*.
It's unclear exactly why this misperception occurs, but it's generally believed that people base their judgment of movement onset on the time of the decision to act and the prediction of the upcoming movement, instead of on the movement itself.
These and other findings raise important questions about the planning and control of action and our sense of agency and control in the world - because our decision to act and our perception of when we act appear to be distinct from when we in fact do.
