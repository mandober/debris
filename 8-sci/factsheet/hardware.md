## Hard disk drive


### HDD features
* The write head of a modern (2018) HDD flies `~5 nm` above the disk's surface.
* HDD data density (2018) is `~15 GB/cm^2`
* HDD invented: *IBM* team led by *Rey Johnson* in **1954**
* HDD first model: **IBM 350 Disk Storage Unit**


### The first HDD
- invented: Dec 1954
  - inventor: IBM team led by Rey Johnson
  - prototype: June 1956
  - announced: Sep 1956 by IBM
  - retail: Nov 1957
- first HDD model: **IBM 350** _disk storage unit_ (DSU)

The first disk drive ever: **IBM 350 disk storage unit**; succesfully prototyped in 1956, announced by IBM in 1956, begun shipping in 1957.
- capacity: 3.75 MB (5e+6 6-bit characters)
- disk diameter: 610 mm
- platters/disks number: 50
- recording surface: 100 (both sides of a platter)
- tracks per surface: 100
- rotation speed: 1200 rpm
- data transfer rate: 8,800 char/s
- price: leased for $3,200 per month (IBM RAMAC 305 system + IBM 350 DSU)
- withdrawn: 1969 (IBM 350 officially withdrawn)


An access mechanism moves a pair of heads up and down to select a disk pair (one down surface and one up surface) and in and out to select a recording track of a surface pair.

Storing 5,000,000 chars, with each char being 6-bit, takes 3.6 MiB = ~3.75MB    
6 bits_per_char * 5e6 chars = 30,000,000 bits    
30,000,000 bits = 3,750,000 Bytes = 3,662 KiB = 3.6 MiB
